    "text": "1.1 Annual swings in atmospheric CO2\nThe longest-running record of direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, atop a volcano on Hawaii. This record has become iconic for documenting the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 - a greenhouse gas - since the great economic acceleration after the Second World War. This has provided a basis for understanding the relationship between emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere and for estimating the climate impact of this important greenhouse gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Atmospheric CO2 from Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The red curve represents monthly mean values. The black curve represents the same after removing an average seasonal cycle. Source: Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA/GML (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).\n\n\n\n\nThe time series in Figure 1.1 shows not only the accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 over the past decades, but also its regular annual swings - the “breathing of the Earth”. This is the result of the seasonal cycles in CO2 uptake and release by terrestrial ecosystems. CO2 uptake peaks in early early summer in the northern extratropics - driven by the high light availability and high photosynthetic rates of young leaves in the early summer months. CO2 release by respiring plants and soil microbes has a shifted seasonality and tends to have a smaller amplitude, compared to CO2 uptake. The net of the two drives changes in atmospheric CO2 which are measured here in the free atmosphere - unaffected by local anthropogenic sources - atop a volcano on Hawaii."

    "text": "1.2 Year-to-year changes of the global carbon budget\nAnthropogenic carbon emissions in the form of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and from land use change, are partly taken up by the ocean and partly by terrestrial ecosystems. The remainder remains in the atmosphere and drives the atmospheric CO2 growth (see Figure 1.1). Each of these components gets estimated and updated each year as the Global Carbon Budget. The latest scientific publication is Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\nEstimates of each compenent are largely independent and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. Fossil emissions are based on energy statistics and cement production data, land use emissions are based on land-use and land-use change data and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based products. The land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Component fluxes of the annual global carbon budget since 1850. Positive components are emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon emissions get redistributed by the global carbon cycle. This redistribution is governed carbon uptake by the ocean (‘ocean sink’) and carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (‘land sink’), while the remainder accumulates in the atmosphere (‘atmospheric growth’). The dashed red line is mirrored from the solid red line and its difference to the blue line indicates the budget imbalance. All fluxes are given in GtC yr\\(^{-1}\\) (gigatons of carbon per year, 1 Gt = 10\\(^9\\) t = 1 Pg = 10\\(^{12}\\) g). Figure from Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows that the largest year-to-year variations in the redistribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is in the land sink component. While variations in the ocean sink and in emissions are relatively small, the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere varies strongly between years. This leads to substantial variations in annual atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Annual variations in the land C balance have been found to originate mostly from semi-arid regions, where large year-to-year variations in precipitation, often linked to El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation climate variability, alter water limitation of vegetation and drought-related disturbances, including fire activity (Ahlström et al. 2015; Humphrey et al. 2018). This leads to large year-to-year variability in CO2 uptake and release by land ecosystems and leaves an imprint on the rise in atmospheric CO2. This also demonstrates the sensitivity of terrestrial C storage to climatic variations and that the response of the land biosphere to climate extremes can drastically alter the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus the rate of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhlström, Anders, Michael R.
