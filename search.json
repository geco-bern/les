It is written by Prof. Benjamin Stocker, Institute of Geography, University of Bern.\nThis book introduces processes of the terrestrial biosphere and how they drive Earth system dynamics. The course starts with identifying general patterns in vegetation, carbon, and water fluxes and stocks, and connects them with underlying principles, governing controls, and quantitative frameworks for their description and prediction. A special focus will be put on introducing the role of terrestrial biosphere in driving and being driven by climate change and global environmental change.\nThe book covers a diverse thematic ground - as diverse as the processes of the biosphere. Topics range from biogeography, the global carbon cycle, land-climate interactions, ecohydrology, to Earth system dynamics.",

    "text": "1.1 Annual swings in atmospheric CO2\nThe longest-running record of direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, atop a volcano on Hawaii. This record has become iconic for documenting the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 - a greenhouse gas - since the great economic acceleration after the Second World War. This has provided a basis for understanding the relationship between emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere and for estimating the climate impact of this important greenhouse gas.\nFigure 1.1: Atmospheric CO2 from Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The red curve represents monthly mean values. The black curve represents the same after removing an average seasonal cycle. Source: Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA/GML (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).\nThe time series in Figure 1.1 shows not only the accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 over the past decades, but also its regular annual swings - the “breathing of the Earth”. This is the result of the seasonal cycles in CO2 uptake and release by terrestrial ecosystems. CO2 uptake peaks in early early summer in the northern extratropics - driven by the high light availability and high photosynthetic rates of young leaves in the early summer months. CO2 release by respiring plants and soil microbes has a shifted seasonality and tends to have a smaller amplitude, compared to CO2 uptake. The net of the two drives changes in atmospheric CO2 which are measured here in the free atmosphere - unaffected by local anthropogenic sources - atop a volcano on Hawaii.",

    "text": "1.2 Year-to-year changes of the global carbon budget\nAnthropogenic carbon emissions in the form of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and from land use change, are partly taken up by the ocean and partly by terrestrial ecosystems. The remainder remains in the atmosphere and drives the atmospheric CO2 growth (see Figure 1.1). Each of these components gets estimated and updated each year as the Global Carbon Budget. The latest scientific publication is Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\nEstimates of each compenent are largely independent and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. Fossil emissions are based on energy statistics and cement production data, land use emissions are based on land-use and land-use change data and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based products. The land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models (Friedlingstein et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Component fluxes of the annual global carbon budget since 1850. Positive components are emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon emissions get redistributed by the global carbon cycle. This redistribution is governed carbon uptake by the ocean (‘ocean sink’) and carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (‘land sink’), while the remainder accumulates in the atmosphere (‘atmospheric growth’). The dashed red line is mirrored from the solid red line and its difference to the blue line indicates the budget imbalance. All fluxes are given in GtC yr\\(^{-1}\\) (gigatons of carbon per year, 1 Gt = 10\\(^9\\) t = 1 Pg = 10\\(^{12}\\) g). Figure from Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows that the largest year-to-year variations in the redistribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is in the land sink component. While variations in the ocean sink and in emissions are relatively small, the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere varies strongly between years. This leads to substantial variations in annual atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Annual variations in the land C balance have been found to originate mostly from semi-arid regions, where large year-to-year variations in precipitation, often linked to El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation climate variability, alter water limitation of vegetation and drought-related disturbances, including fire activity (Ahlström et al. 2015; Humphrey et al. 2018). This leads to large year-to-year variability in CO2 uptake and release by land ecosystems and leaves an imprint on the rise in atmospheric CO2. This also demonstrates the sensitivity of terrestrial C storage to climatic variations and that the response of the land biosphere to climate extremes can drastically alter the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus the rate of climate change.",

    "text": "1.3 Responses to rapid climate change in the past\nThe climate of the past 11,000 years (11 ka) until the Industrial Revolution was relatively stable, at least in comparison to the climate of the Last Glacial period. This period was marked by millennial-scale climate oscillations where temperatures rose by up to 16\\(^\\circ\\)C within a few decades (Oeschger et al. 1984; Dansgaard et al. 1993). When first discovered in measurments of an ice core recovered from Greenland, the massive excursions of the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal - a proxy for air temperature - were considered a measurement error. But the correspondence of similar excursions measured on a different Greenland ice core and the coincidence of the most recent such excursion with a similar pattern found in the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal of carbonate in the lake sediment of Gerzensee (near Bern) (Oeschger et al. 1984) confirmed the robustness of these rapid climate change events in the past. Reflecting this, these rapid climate swings between about 80 and 10 ka BP were named Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Today, Dansgaard-Oeschger events are undersood to be oscillations of the Earth system that occurr without external triggers, but arise from the interaction of ocean and ice sheet dynamics, and are confined to Earth system states corresponding to the glacial periods of the late Pleistocene (Stocker and Johnsen 2003; Vettoretti et al. 2022).\nThe terrestrial biosphere was strongly affected by these large and rapid climate changes and left its imprints in several palaeo records (Figure 1.3). In response to the climate warming, atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations increased rapidly. Natural CH4 sources almost exclusively in land ecosystems (wetlands, fire). In parallel, the amount of dust transported to Greenland declined rapidly as climate warmed. This reflects an expansion of vegetation cover into dust-forming regions (e.g., deserts and peri-glacial areas). Also in parallel, nitrous oxide (N2O), another greenhouse gas, increased. This increase unfolded more gradually and reflects both oceanic and terrestrial sources. Furthermore, fire activity in the northern hemisphere, measured by charcoal deposits in Greenland ice cores, increased as the climate warmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Ice core and biomass burning records of Earth system changes during Dansgaard-Oeschger events - rapid climate change events during the last Glacial period, between 80 and 10 ka BP (kilo-years, 10\\(^{3}\\) years before present). Shading indicates significant patterns in the response of the time series to the events of abrupt warming and rapid cooling. (a) \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal is a proxy for air temperature.

(2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variations in land-mediated greenhouse gases, dust, and fire are attest to the large and hemisphere-scale changes in terrestrial biosphere functioning in response to climate variations. Of course, greenhouse gases, dust, and fire-related emissions of CO2 and aerosols are radiative forcing agents themselves and thus affect the climate. These changes during Dansgaard-Oescher events thus demonstrate the important role of the land biosphere in mediating Earth system changes.",

    "text": "2.1 A global view of vegetation\nWe start with the observation that the global distribution of plants and characteristic assemblies of different plant species is not random, but relates to climate. Around the beginning of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt pursued expeditions to different places on Earth and connected the multitude of his local observations into a global view of biogeography. He was the first to realise that vegetation zones along elevational gradients were shifted across different mountain ranges on different continents and located on different latitudes, and that the elevational and latitudinal patterns in vegetation were related to climate - in much the same way across the earth. This finding is visualised by the schematic scientific drawing in Figure 2.1. The figure illustrates, for example, that the treeline increases from the high northern latitudes of Lapland at 68\\(^\\circ\\)N to the Alps and Pyrenees at 42-46\\(^\\circ\\)N and to the Himalaya at 29-32\\(^\\circ\\)N. Or that the elevation at which Betula alba (birch) grows varies from 1000-2000 ft in Lapland, to 4000-5000 ft in the Alps, and about 15,000 ft in the Himalaya. Figure 2.1 also illustrates that the treeline doesn’t increase monotonically with decreasing latitude. Although not spelled out in the figure, this is a hint at the importance of water, along with temperature, for controlling vegetation. We’ll revisit this observation later in this book. Humboldt’s integration of globally distributed observations into his global view of climate as a driver of vegetation was pioneering and forms the basis of our modern approach to understanding and modelling global vegetation patterns and how they are influenced by climate change.\nFigure 2.1: Vegetation zones along elevation and latitude.

    "text": "2.2 Biomes\nToday’s geodata provides information on climate and vegetation properties with global coverage. This enables a global mapping of vegetation, filling in the blank spots between the local observations made by Alexander von Humboldt 200 years ago. Global patterns in the distribution of vegetation become apparent when grouping plants and plant functional types (see Section 2.2.2) into biomes or broad vegetation classes. A global map of biomes following the definition and global delineation by Olson et al. (2001) is given in Figure 2.2. The exact delineation and naming of biomes varies between different sources, but the main distinctions are shared among all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Fourteen biomes and the locations of sites representative for each biome (used below).\n\n\n\n\n\nEach biome is characterised by the types of dominant plants (plant functional types), their characteristics (traits), ecosystem structural and functional properties, and landscape processes (e.g., fire). Underlying all of this is the characteristic climate. The following biome classification (based on Bonan (2015) and slightly deviating from Olson et al. (2001)) can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClick on the biome names below to open a tab that lists some key characteristics and provides a Walter-Lieth climate diagram for a representative site, located in that biome. The sites are locations where ecoystem water and carbon fluxes, along with meteorological variables, are measured. We will revisit data from these same sites in later chapters, then with a focus on water and carbon fluxes and the phenology. The locations of the sites are indicated on the map in Figure 2.2.\nWalter-Lieth climate diagrams show monthly climatologies of average temperature and precipitation on the same axis and scaled such that months where the blue curve (precipitation, mm month-1) is above the red curve (temperature, \\(^\\circ\\)C) indicates humid periods and the opposite relative curve positions indicates dry periods. Dry periods are roughly indicating when potential evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation (see Chapter 7). Blue bars along the x-axis indicate months with likely frost. Annotations on the top of the graph indicate the observation period (left), the mean annual temperature (center), and the mean annual precipitation (right).

Acknowledging their intricate relationship with climate, biomes can also be delineated in climate space - in a diagram defined by mean annual temperature (MAT) along one axis and mean annual precipitation (MAP) along the other axis. This yields a plot following Whittaker (1975). Note that the biome definition shown in Figure 2.12 does not exactly match the definition of biomes given above as it is mainly aimed at separating with respect to MAT and MAP. For example, Mediterranean forests are not separated in the “Whittaker-plot”. This is because their characteristic climate is not distinguished by annual means, but by the seasonality of temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# library(devtools)\n# devtools::install_github(\"valentinitnelav/plotbiomes\")\nlibrary(plotbiomes)\nplotbiomes::whittaker_base_plot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Biomes in climate space, defined by mean annual temperature and precipitation, following Whittaker (1975).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Plant functional types\nEach biome is characterised by a typical assembly of plant functional types (PFT). PFTs are a grouping of plant species based on their key physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics. That is, we can distinguish between annual (mostly grasses and herbs) and perennial (mostly trees and shrubs) plants, between needle-leaved and broadleaved trees, and between deciduous and evergreen trees. A key physiological distinction can further be made between grasses following the C3 vs. the C4 photosynthetic pathway (see Chapter 4). Thereby, the bewildering diversity of the animal kingdom can be reduced to a small set of PFT. A common categorisation distinguishes the following PFTs:\n\nneedle-leaved evergreen trees\nbroadleaved evergreen trees\nneedle-leaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved annuals (herbs)\nC3 grasses\nC4 grasses\n\nGlobal vegetation models use PFTs as their basic unit of distinguishing plants. The exact delineation of PFTs implemented in such models may vary from the list given above. Further distinctions may be made and are relevant in a global vegetation and carbon cycle modelling context. For example, only a relatively small subset of plants are known to associate with symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules of the host plant (“N-fixing plants”, see also #sec-nutrients). This association is highly relevant for the N economy of the plant and its productivity and competitiveness under different levels of N availability.\nPlants can also be distinguished into the botanical classification of angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnnosperms (seed-producing plants that include conifers, cycads, and Ginkgo). The distinction between angiosperms and gymnosperms largely aligns with the distinction between needle-leaved and broadleaved plants (but see Ginkgo). The two groups not only distinguished by their phylogenetic heritage, but also by essential characteristics that relate to the efficiency by which they photosynthesise and transpire water. Angiosperm leaves typically exhibit higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates, and are thinner and shorter-lived than leaves of gymnosperms. These differences relate to differences in how the water transport system (plant hydraulics) is built. A larger number and a wider diameter of water transport organs in angiosperms enable a higher water conductivity - essential for sustaining higher photosynthetic rates than in gymnosperms.\n\n\n2.2.3 Traits\nThe physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics that distinguish PFTs determine their productivity and competitiveness in a given climate. Such characteristics are referred to as plant functional traits, or often just traits. Plant species can be described by a set of traits and a set of certain traits yields the distinction into PFTs described above: leaf habit (deciduous vs. evergreen), leaf form (needle-leaved vs. broadleaved), and the life history strategy distinguising annual vs. perennial. A range of additional traits are commonly described and investigated scientifically. Here, we will not consider additional ones. The concept of a plant functional trait is that it describes a largely immutable characteristic of a plant species that determines metabolic rates (photosynthesis, respiration) and their relationship to the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature), nutrient and water demand, and ultimately its demographic rates (growth, fecundity, mortality) and thus competitiveness.\nToday’s global distribution of species and biomes (assuming no intervention by human land use and forest management) is the outcome of competition and thus reflects the combination of plant functional traits that optimises competitiveness of a species under the present-day climate. The distribution of biomes and PFTs is thus a direct reflection of the climate.\nFor example, whether a region is dominated by deciduous or by evergreen trees and forests is determined by the benefits and costs for a plant of maintaining leaves year-round. Evergreen trees benefit from the ability to photosynthesise and gain carbon around the year. For example, in Mediterranean regions, although light levels are lower in winter than in summer, ample moisture and non-negligible light enables evergreen trees to assimilate carbon also during winter months. However, leaves and needles of evergreen plants have to be built for lasting several years. Such leaves are typically much thicker than those of deciduous trees and thus require more carbon per unit leaf area for their construction. The leaf mass per unit leaf area is commonly referred to as the leaf mass per area, LMA, and is an important additional plant trait as it is directly linked to a plant’s carbon balance. Over the leaf lifespan, the initial high construction costs of high-LMA leaves are outweighed by the additional carbon assimilation during periods when deciduous trees shed their leaves.\nLeaf-shedding of deciduous trees, in contrast, is a strategy to avoid having to build costly long-lasting leaves and maintaining them year-round (which also incurs an additional respiration cost, also in the form of carbon). Leaves are shed during periods when the climate is unfavourable for photosynthesis - during cold and dark winter months, or during excessively dry periods.\nNote that plant functional traits are often not entirely immutable. Instead, traits may vary also within a species and these variations are often driven by the environment. This is called acclimation. Such variations can even arise over the course of a season. For example, photosynthetic traits can rapidly acclimate to the large changes in light availability over the course of a year. Some traits are more plastic than others. For example, a tree is either needle-leaved or broadleaved. There is no continuum between the two leaf forms. In contrast, the nitrogen content per unit leaf mass is relatively plastic within a species.\nA changing environment changes the competitiveness of a given species, i.e., of a given trait combination. As a result, some traits may acclimate to some extent within a weeks to years. Over longer time scales, the altered demographic rates in a new climate affect the competitiveness of a species (even after some of its traits may have acclimated to a new climate) and ultimately shift demographic rates and the community composition. In grasslands, where the demographic cycle is short, such community composition changes may unfold over time scales of a few years. In forests, the longevity of an individual tree is on the order of decades to centuries and community composition changes unfold on correspondingly long time scale.",

    "text": "2.3 Global vegetation patterns\nThe biome classification is a way to discretise vegetation based on several characteristics (e.g., tree cover fraction). However, many of these characteristics describe observable variables that vary more or less gradually across environmental gradients and each of these variables can be mapped across the globe thanks to modern Earth observation data. These global patterns of different observable variables reflect how the climate influences vegetation structure and functioning across the globe - independent of a classification into biomes. In much of the remainder of this course, we will investigate these vegetation-climate relationships without considering the biome classification. These relationships are informative for understanding how different processes of terrestrial ecology, plant physiology, the carbon cycle, and land-climate interactions are driven by the environment and vary across the globe.\n\nVegetation heightLeaf area indexBiomassTree cover fraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: The global distribution of vegetation height from Simard et al.

Therefore, the pixels for which data is used for visualising the vegetation height per biome is biased towards particularly tall vegetation in these areas. Consequently, the distribution of vegetation heights in the biome ‘Tundra’ appears implausibly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Annual maximum leaf area index, averaged over years 2000-2008.

    "text": "2.4 Vegetation types\nNote that the categorisation of vegetation into biomes is different from the categorisation of vegetation into vegetation types or land cover classes. A widely used distinction of vegetation types/land cover classes is that of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Vegetation types distinguish what can be seen from space and are thus amenable to remote-sensing based land cover classification. However, for example, different types of evergreen broadleaved forests are not distinguished (e.g., moist tropical, Mediterranean, and temperate evergreen broadleaved forests). Also, vegetation types/land cover classes distinguish land cover that is dominated by human activities (agricultural and urban), while biomes distinguish naturally occurring (i.e., without human influence) vegetation zones.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: IGBP vegetation types/land cover classes.

    "text": "2.5 Climate zones\nWhile the biome categorisation is based on plant functional types and reflects a mix of vegetation types and climate, the categorisation into vegetation types is independent of climate, but purely based on vegetation and land cover properties that can be sensed from space. In contrast to this approach, we may focus exclusively on the climate and distinguish climate zones that largely align with the major biomes. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Köppen 1884) is based on a hierarchical classification that separates climate based on values and the seasonality of monthly air temperature and precipitation. Water availability during the main vegetation periods and temperature minima during winter and maxima during summer are recognized to be particularly influential for the composition of the vegetation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.21: Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. Taken from Beck et al. (2018) and adapted from Peel, Finlayson, and McMahon (2007). Variable definitions: MAT = mean annual air temperature (°C); \\(T_{cold} =\\) the air temperature of the coldest month (°C); \\(T_{hot} =\\) the air temperature of the warmest month (°C); \\(T_{mon10} =\\) the number of months with air temperature &gt;10 °C (unitless); MAP = mean annual precipitation (mm y\\(^{−1}\\)); \\(P_{dry} =\\) precipitation in the driest month (mm month\\(^{−1}\\)); \\(P_{sdry} =\\) precipitation in the driest month in summer (mm month\\(^{−1}\\)); Pwdry = precipitation in the driest month in winter (mm month\\(^{−1}\\)); \\(P_{swet} =\\) precipitation in the wettest month in summer (mm month\\(^{−1}\\)); \\(P_{wwet} =\\) precipitation in the wettest month in winter (mm month\\(^{−1}\\)); \\(P_{threshold}\\) = 2×MAT if &gt;70% of precipitation falls in winter, \\(P_{threshold}\\) = 2×MAT+28 if &gt;70% of precipitation falls in summer, otherwise \\(P_{threshold}\\) = 2×MAT+14. Summer (winter) is the six-month period that is warmer (colder) between April-September and October-March.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the classification scheme described in Figure 2.21 and data of monthly climatologies, the climate zones can be mapped across the globe (Figure 2.22).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Köppen-Geiger climate zones for a present-day climate (1980-2016).

    "section": "2.6 Hillslope-scale heterogeneity",
    "text": "2.6 Hillslope-scale heterogeneity\nTopography shapes microclimates and drives small-scale variations in hydrology. In mountain regions, vegetation may thus vary strongly along small spatial scales - on the order of 10-103 m. This scale - from the river channel to the ridge - is referred to as the hillslope scale. In much the same way as climate drives vegetation across biomes, so it does across the hillslope scale. The incident solar radiation and - as a consequence of that - near-surface air temperatures are affected by the local slope, aspect, and shading by the surrounding topography. Soil moisture and the groundwater table depth are affected by lateral subsurface flow of water, driven by gradients in water potentials along topographical gradients. Subsurface water flow converges in depressions and concave terrain (e.g., in valley bottoms) and diverges in convex terrain. (e.g., on ridges and hilltops). As a consequence, the water table is shallow in valley bottoms and deep under ridges. Radiation and hydrology thus create microclimates and plant water availability conditions that are shaped by topography and variations in vegetation that are shaped by the microclimates and hydrological conditions.\nThese hillslope-scale variations “intersect” with the the background climate (average climate across larger spatial scales, on the order of 104-105 m). A shallow groundwater table and moist soils in valley bottoms can promote plant productivity in arid regions and seasons. In contrast, in a humid climate, a very shallow water table in valley bottoms inhibits plant productivity due to anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils and the inability of roots to penetrate into permanently water-saturated soil. Similarly, the influence of radiation in promoting versus inhibiting plant productivity depends on the background climate. In cold climates of the high northern latitudes, the solar zenith angle is relatively high, also in mid-summer. This creates a strong influence of the local slope and aspect. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive more radiation - a difference to north-facing slopes that can be critical for sustaining tree growth in high northern regions. In contrast, elevated incident solar radiation in south-facing slopes can aggravate water limitation and suppress vegetation productivity in more arid climates of the subtropics and mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.23: Hillslope effects on vegetation in different background climate zones. Top-left: Hydrology promoting vegetation in valley bottoms in a semi-arid climate in Arizona, USA (Source: wikipedia.org). Top-right: Hydrology inhibiting vegetation in topographic depressions in a humid climate due to seasonal waterlogging in the Pantanal region (Source: wikimapia.org). Bottom-left: Radiation inhibiting vegetation on south-facing (sun-exposed) slopes in Texas, USA (Source: thecommonmilkweed.blogspot.com). Bottom-right: Radiation promoting vegetation on south-facing (sun-exposed) slopes in southwest Yukon, Canada (Source: photo by Ryan Danby, Queen’s University, Canada). Figure extracted from Fan et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate also varies along elevation due to thermodynamics and radiative transfer in the atmosphere - independent of the slope and aspect of the local terrain. Temperatures decline following the lapse rate in the troposphere, leading to a shift of vegetation zones along elevational gradients. This phenomenon is depicted also in Humboldt’s drawings (Figure 2.1). Radiation levels are elevated at high altitudes due to a shorter path length and thus reduced absorption by the atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen declines with elevation. This implies reduced respiration and an increased efficiency of photosynthesis.\nSmall-scale variations in vegetation may also be driven my variations in soil characteristics and bedrock lithology which influences drainage and soil chemistry (pH, nutrient availability). Where the ground is seasonally snow-covered, very small-scale terrain features (100-102) and dominant wind directions drive snow accumulation and dispersion, leading to substantial small-scale variations in maximum snow depth and the duration of seasonal snow cover - with implications for plants (Körner and Hiltbrunner 2021).\n\n\n\n\nBeck, Hylke E., Niklaus E.

    "text": "3.1 The pre-industrial carbon cycle\nCarbon is an abundant element, present in all organic matter - matter produced by biota (living organisms) - and in inorganic forms in the atmosphere, the ocean, and the lithosphere. On land, the vast majority of C is present in organic forms in living biomass - mostly of vegetation (450 PgC) and soil organic matter (1700 PgC excluding permafrost). Of the latter, a particularly large stock of C is stored in permafrost soils (1200 PgC). In the ocean, the vast majority of C mass is present in inorganic forms, dissolved in ocean water, of which 900 PgC is stored in the surface ocean (the well-mixed top few hundred meters) and 37,100 PgC is stored in the deep ocean. Dissolved organic carbon in the ocean makes up 700 PgC and 1750 PgC are stored as carbonate shells in ocean floor sediments. In the pre-industrial Earth, 591 PgC were present as CO2 in the atmosphere.\nFigure 3.1: Global carbon (CO2) budget (2010–2019). Yellow arrows represent annual carbon fluxes (in PgC yr-1) associated with the natural carbon cycle, estimated for the time prior to the industrial era, around 1750. Pink arrows represent anthropogenic fluxes averaged over the period 2010–2019. The rate of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is equal to net land-use change emissions, including land management plus fossil fuel emissions, minus land and ocean net sinks (plus a small budget imbalance). Circles with yellow numbers represent pre-industrial carbon stocks in PgC. Circles with pink numbers represent anthropogenic changes to these stocks (cumulative anthropogenic fluxes) since 1750. The relative change of gross photosynthesis since pre-industrial times is based on 15 Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. The corresponding emissions by total respiration and fire are those required to match the net land flux, exclusive of net land-use change emissions which are accounted for separately. The cumulative change of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of carbon cumulatively lost by net land-use change emissions, and net carbon accumulated since 1750 in response to environmental drivers (warming, rising CO2, nitrogen deposition). Figure from Canadell et al. (2021).\nUnder the relatively stable climate of the pre-industrial Holocene (11,700 yr BP - 1750 CE), the size of the C pools described above remained relatively stable. To simplify, we can conceive them as constant (at steady state) under the pre-industrial Holocene climate. This is a simplification. For example, millennial-scale trends in solar radiation inputs over the seasons and latitudes (driven by slight changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun), caused climate and vegetation changes that were substantial and in certain cases abrupt (e.g., the demise of the Green Sahara between around 6-3 ka BP (Shanahan et al. 2015)).\nEven under such a pre-industrial steady state, C fluxes between the major reservoirs or pools (atmosphere, ocean, land) persisted. This is indicated in Figure 3.1 by the wide orange arrows pointing up and down between the land and the atmosphere and between the ocean and the atmosphere, as well as between different pools within the ocean. In a steady state, the C flux from the atmosphere into the land roughly equals the flux from the land to the atmosphere, and the net exchange flux is zero. Hence, the pool sizes remain constant in spite of the ongoing exchange fluxes between them. We speak of a dynamic equilibrium.",

    "text": "3.2 Carbon pool dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1st-order decay model\n\n\n\nThe concept of pools and fluxes is central for describing and modelling the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles in the environment. The dynamics of a pool \\(C(t)\\) is given by the balance of the flux of C into that pool \\(I(t)\\) and the flux \\(O(t)\\) leaving the pool - over time \\(t\\). In general terms, we can write the temporal change of the pool size as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I(t) - O(t) \\;.\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nTo simplify the expressions, we will omit \\((t)\\) below. But remember, that the fluxes and pools vary with time. The assumption that the out-flux \\(O\\) scales linearly with the size of the pool \\(C\\) is a good simplifying description (i.e., a model) for many processes in the environment. For example, the amount of CO2 produced by the decomposition (decay) of organic matter in the soil scales roughly linearly with the amount of organic matter that is being respired. This leads to the 1st-order decay model of pool dynamics:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - kC \\;.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Here, \\(k\\) is a decay constant and is in units of the inverse of time. In other words, it specifies the fraction of \\(C\\) decaying per unit time (e.g,. seconds, or years). The higher \\(k\\), the more rapidly the pool decays. For the case of \\(I=0\\), we get \\(\\mathrm{d}C/\\mathrm{d}t = -kC\\). This is a differential equation and can be understood as: What is the function that yields itself, multiplied by \\(-k\\), when taking its derivative with respect to time? The solution is:\n\\[\nC(t) = C_0 \\; e^{-kt} \\;.\n\\] For example, following this model, the pool of C in soil organic matter would decay exponentially if inputs (litterfall) were zero. The decay constant \\(k\\) determines how long it takes for it to be reduced by a certain factor. A commonly used factor is 0.5. We can calculate a half-life - the time \\(t\\) at which \\(C(t) = 0.5\\;C_0\\).\nIn a dynamic equilibrium the change in the pool size \\(C\\) is by definition zero. \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \\;.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Combining Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3 and re-arranging terms leads to the steady-state pool size as a function of the in-flux and the decay constant \\(k\\). \\[\nC^\\ast = I/k\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Here, the asterisk denotes that \\(C\\) is at steady-state. This solution indicates two aspects. First, the size of the steady-state pool is proportional to the input flux. Note that we assumed that the input flux itself has no dependency on \\(C\\). Second, the size of the steady-state pool is inversely proportional to the decay constant. That is, the faster the decay, the smaller the steady state pool.\nEquation 3.2 can also be expressed in terms of an average lifetime or turnover time \\(\\tau\\), instead of \\(k\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - C/\\tau \\;.\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nConsider the C pool of the intermediate and deep sea (37,100 PgC) in Figure 3.1 (bottom right). What is the turnover time of C in that pool?\nExpress the steady-state pool size \\(C^\\ast\\) as a function of the in-flux and the turnover time \\(\\tau\\).\nExpress the half-life constant as a function of \\(k\\).\nDo you know about other processes in nature that can be described by the 1st-order decay model?\n\n\n\nWith the information in Figure 3.1 about pool sizes and steady-state gross fluxes (parallel input and output fluxes), and our model of pool dynamics, we get an insight about how fast C is cycling in and out of different pools. \\(k=I/C^\\ast\\) is a measure of this cycling rate. Or expressed in terms of its inverse, the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) measures how long a C atom resides in that pool. Table 3.1 documents the turnover times for major pools of the global carbon cycle. The small C burial fluxes into sediments on land and on the ocean floor are the supply of what is eventually converted into the very large pool of C in carbonate rock (limestone). A small fraction of the C burial flux is in the form of organic matter, including dead plants, algae, and other microorganisms. Under high heat and pressure, a fraction of it contributes to the formation of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas - fossil fuels. The discrepancy in turnover times between the lithosphere C pool and the other pools indicates that C cycles on vastly different time scales and the slow geological C cycle is largely disconnected from “fast” C cycle between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. Reflecting this discrepancy in time scales, the geological C cycle is not depicted in Figure 3.1 and C in fossil fuel reservoirs is treated as an external input to the fast C cycle.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Pre-industrial pool sizes, input fluxes, and turnover times of major pools of the global carbon cycle. The preindustrial input flux into the atmosphere is calculated as the sum of fluxes from volcanism, total respiration and fire, freshwater, and ocean-atmosphere gas exchange from Figure 3.1. The input flux into the surface ocean is the sum of ocean-atmosphere gas exchange and the flux from intermediate and deep sea. The flux from marine biota is not additional to the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux. The pool size of the biosphere is taken as the sum of vegetation and soils. The permafrost C pool is relatively inert. The size of the lithosphere C pool includes C in the form of sedimentary (carbonate) rocks and kerogens (solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks). Its estimate is based on Falkowski et al. (2000). The input flux into the lithosphere is calculated as the sum of burial on land, rock weathering, and ocean floor sedimentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPool\nPool size (PgC)\nInput flux (PgC yr-1)\nTurnover time (yr)\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n591\n167.3\n3.5\n\n\nSurface ocean\n900\n329\n2.7\n\n\nDeep ocean\n37,000\n(see exercise 3.1)\n(see exercise 3.1)\n\n\nBiosphere\n2150\n113\n19\n\n\nLithosphere\n75,000,000\n0.7\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) describes the average time that an atom of C resides in the respective pool. This is a simplification. In the C pool ‘terrestrial biosphere’, not every C atom has the same probability of being oxidized and respired as CO2. Hence, in reality, \\(\\tau\\) is a wide distribution, ranging from seconds to years for non-structural carbon derived from photosynthesis, decades to centuries for C in woody biomass, and to millennia for a small fraction of soil organic matter, especially if the C is protected from oxidation, for example in water-logged soils. The turnover time should therefore be understood as a diagnostic, useful for describing the average systems dynamics in a simplified way, and subsuming multiple processes that operate at different time scales, contributing to different portions of C conversion to CO2.\nThe range of turnover times (e.g., within the terrestrial biosphere) arise because C is transferred between multiple pools within the biosphere and the ocean. Going to the next more detailed level of abstraction (model representation), multiple C pools in terrestrial ecosystems can be distinguished (e.g., non-structural C, leaves, roots, wood, litter, soil organic matter, microbes). Some C “cascades” through multiple pools, some is quickly respired back into the atmosphere. The interpretation that \\(k\\) equals the inverse of the turnover time \\(\\tau\\), and that the turnover time equals the mean age of all C atoms in that pool, and that the mean transit time (the time it takes between an atom of C entering a pool until it exits that pool again) equals \\(\\tau\\) is only valid for certain cases, and not for “C cascades” with fluxes between multiple pools. Requirements are that we’re dealing with a single well-mixed pool, that this pool is at steady-state, that it has been so for an infinitely long time, that \\(I\\) and \\(k\\) are constant over time, and the flux leaving the pool is a linear function of the pool size (\\(O=kC\\)) (Sierra et al. 2017). The transit time is the same as residence time - a term used more commonly in hydrology.",

    "text": "3.3 The anthropogenic perturbation\nAlthough fossil fuels are formed by natural processes of the C cycle, their combustion can be regarded as an external input of C into the (modern) global C cycle. This is because the time scale at which the reservoir of fossil fuels is depleted (102 yr) stands in stark contrast to the time scale at which it was formed (108 yr, see turnover time of C in the lithosphere in Table 3.1). The C is added in the form of CO2 to the atmosphere from where it is taken up by the ocean through diffusion and equilibration of the ocean surface water’s CO2 partial pressure with the atmosphere’s CO2 partial pressure, and by the terrestrial biosphere through photosynthesis. It is important to note that CO2 in the atmosphere does not decay through physical or chemical processes, nor are there C sinks on land or in the ocean that remove C away from the “fast” C cycle - except the burial into sediments (see Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1). However the magnitude of the burial fluxes are dwarfed by the magnitude of C inputs through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Hence, the present-day C emissions drive an accumulation of the total amount of C cycling in the “fast” C cycle and the added C gets redistributed between the spheres. The net fluxes from the atmosphere into land ecosystems and the ocean arise because the total terrestrial and oceanic C pools are increasing as CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere and the atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising. In subsequent chapters (Chapter 4 and Chapter 5), we will learn about the processes driving the CO2 uptake by land and ocean and the dynamics of the C redistribution in the Earth system. In this chapter, we will look at the global C budget - how much C has been emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation and how much of this C has accumulated in the atmosphere and how much has been taken up by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere?\nThe global C budget can be defined for globally aggregated fluxes as the balance between emissions from fossil fuels \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) and land use change \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) on the left side of the equation and the redistribution of C among the atmosphere, land and ocean. \\(G_\\mathrm{atm}\\) is the atmospheric growth rate, \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) is the net ocean C uptake (also referred to as the ocean sink) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is the net land C uptake (or land sink). A net flux from the atmosphere into the ocean or into land C storage is positive.\n\\[\nE_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} = G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nThis terminology is adopted from the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2023) and is expressed as global annual total fluxes. The separation of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is not straight-forward, but can be understood in a simplified fashion as spatially separated fluxes, whereby the land sink occurs only on areas that are not affected by land use change (LUC). In reality, LUC affects the land sink which complicates a separation of the two components. This is further resolved in Chapter 11.\nThe values of the global carbon budget components are given in Figure 3.1 for an average across years 2010-2019, where \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) corresponds to the ‘net ocean flux’ and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) corresponds to the the ‘net land flux’ in Figure 3.1. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) corresponds to ‘net land-use change’. The ‘net’ indicates that \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) is the net effect between CO2 emissions from deforestation and C uptake by re-growing forests and afforestations. Note that the annual atmospheric growth rate is not resolved in Figure 3.1. The most recent update of the global carbon budget from Friedlingstein et al. (2023) is given in Table 3.2 as 10-year averages of annual fluxes for years 2013-2022 and cumulative fluxes for the industrial era - years 1750-2022.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Global carbon budget (in PgC and PgC yr-1) from the 2023 update by Friedlingstein et al.

Values reported by Friedlingstein et al. (2023) include the cement carbonation sink. Without that sink, the value of \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) for 2022 would be about 0.2 PgC yr-1 higher. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) estimates are based on land-use and land-use change data from national statistics and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. These models use information about vegetation C stocks, forest C re-growth curves, and the fate of C after deforestation and harvesting (e.g., wood products lifetime). Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly and bears the least uncertainty among all carbon budget components. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean CO2 uptake models and observation-based products. In Friedlingstein et al. (2023), the land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models.\nAdvances in observations and modelling in recent years now enable the land and ocean sink to be estimated in a “bottom-up fashion” - using models of land and ocean C uptake. Since every component of the global carbon budget is thereby estimated independently, a budget imbalance term \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) can be defined. A value of zero indicates that models of the land and ocean C uptake exactly match the (better known) emission terms minus the atmospheric growth rate. \\[\nB_\\mathrm{IM} = E_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} - (G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land})\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nToday, the global carbon budget is well specified thanks to reliable estimates of its individual components. The budget imbalance is only a small fraction of the total emissions. Until recently, “bottom-up” estimates of \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) by land C cycle models were deemed insufficient for providing reliable estimates. Instead, \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) was estimated as the budget residual by neglecting \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) and rearranging terms in Equation 3.7 to solve for \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\). In fact, when the IPCC First Assessment Report was published in 1990, the existence of C sink on land was not known and it was treated as a budget imbalance and referred to as the ‘missing sink’. It is stated that “there are possible processes on land which could account for the missing CO2 (but it has not been possible to verify them)”.\nIt was only later that the existence of a terrestrial C sink could be more firmly established and quantified thanks to parallel measurements of the atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations (Keeling, Piper, and Heimann 1996). (In fact, the ratio O2/N2 is measured to avoid the much larger measurement uncertainty in absolute O2 measurements). The ratios of O2:CO2 are known from the stoichiometric molecular formulae for photosynthesis (O2:CO2 = 1.1), fossil fuel combustion (O2:CO2 = 1.4) and ocean uptake (O2:CO2 = 0). An ocean O2 source from marine organisms has to be factored in. Given the total C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, the net land C balance can thus be calculated and the calculation visualized geometrically (Figure 3.2). Note that net emissions from land use change are not considered and the “land sink” in Figure 3.2 is the net of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) in Equation 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Global land and ocean carbon sinks deduced from changes in atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentrations. The figure is an updated version of Fig. 2 from Keeling, Piper, and Heimann (1996), taken from Li et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can adopt the perspective of C cycle science stated in earlier publications. Falkowski et al. (2000) wrote: “Direct determination of changes in terrestrial carbon storage has proven extremely difficult. Rather, the contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon storage is inferred from changes in the concentrations of atmospheric gases, especially CO2 and O2 […].” In that sense, let’s consider the land sink to be the budget residual and assume that the ocean sink estimate is accurate (indeed, its uncertainty is only about half the uncertainty in bottom-up land sink estimates, Table 3.2). Visually contrasting emissions and their redistribution reveals an interesting pattern (Figure 3.3). The substantial year-to-year (interannual) variations in the land sink are almost exclusively responsible for interannual variations in the atmospheric growth rate. Total emissions and the ocean sink exhibit little interannual variation. By definition, the sum of the atmospheric growth rate, land and ocean sink is equal to the sum of emissions from fossil fuels and land use change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUse Equation 3.7 to express the land sink as the budget residual (assuming \\(B_\\mathrm{IM} = 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Data from Friedlingstein et al. 2023.
