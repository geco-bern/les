    "text": "1.1.1 Annual swings in atmospheric CO2\nThe longest-running record of direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, atop a volcano on Hawaii. This record has become iconic for documenting the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 - a greenhouse gas - since the great economic acceleration after the Second World War. This has provided a basis for understanding the relationship between emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere and for estimating the climate impact of this important greenhouse gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Atmospheric CO2 from Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The red curve represents monthly mean values. The black curve represents the same after removing an average seasonal cycle. Source: Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA/GML (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series in Figure 1.1 shows not only the accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 over the past decades, but also its regular annual swings - the “breathing of the Earth”. This is the result of the seasonal cycles in CO2 uptake and release by terrestrial ecosystems. CO2 uptake peaks in early early summer in the northern extra-tropics - driven by the high light availability and high photosynthetic rates of young leaves in the early summer months. CO2 release by respiring plants and soil microbes has a shifted seasonality and tends to have a smaller amplitude, compared to CO2 uptake. The net of the two drives changes in atmospheric CO2 which are measured here in the free atmosphere - unaffected by local anthropogenic sources - atop a volcano on Hawaii.\nThe processes responsible for the breathing of the Earth will be introduced in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.\n\n\n1.1.2 Year-to-year changes of the global carbon budget\nAnthropogenic carbon emissions in the form of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and from land use change, are partly taken up by the ocean and partly by terrestrial ecosystems. The remainder remains in the atmosphere and drives the atmospheric CO2 growth (see Figure 1.1). Each of these components gets estimated and updated each year as the Global Carbon Budget. The latest scientific publication is Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\nEstimates of each component are largely independent and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. Fossil emissions are based on energy statistics and cement production data, land use emissions are based on land-use and land-use change data and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based products. The land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models (Friedlingstein et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Annual carbon emissions (positive) and their redistribution between the ocean, land, and atmosphere (negative). The black line in the positive domain represents total emissions and is mirrored by the black line in the negative domain which represents the total of the land sink, ocean sink, and atmospheric growth. Design and data are based on the Global Carbon Budget. In contrast to Friedlingstein et al. (2023), the land sink is defined here as the carbon budget residual (introduced in Chapter 3). The budget imbalance term - the difference between Sland calculated as the budget residual vs. bottom-up using land C cycle models - is shown by the separate fine grey line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows that the largest year-to-year variations in the redistribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is in the land sink component. While variations in the ocean sink and in emissions are relatively small, the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere varies strongly between years. This leads to substantial variations in annual atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Annual variations in the land C balance have been found to originate mostly from semi-arid regions, where large year-to-year variations in precipitation, often linked to El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation climate variability, alter water limitation of vegetation and drought-related disturbances, including fire activity (Ahlström et al. 2015; Humphrey et al. 2018). This leads to large year-to-year variability in CO2 uptake and release by land ecosystems and leaves an imprint on the rise in atmospheric CO2. This also demonstrates the sensitivity of terrestrial C storage to climatic variations and that the response of the land biosphere to climate extremes can drastically alter the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus the rate of climate change.\nThe global carbon budget will be introduced in Chapter 5.\n\n\n1.1.3 Responses to rapid climate change in the past\nThe climate of the past 11,000 years (11 ka) until the Industrial Revolution was relatively stable, at least in comparison to the climate of the Last Glacial period. This period was marked by millennial-scale climate oscillations where temperatures rose by up to 16\\(^\\circ\\)C within a few decades (Oeschger et al. 1984; Dansgaard et al. 1993). When first discovered in measurments of an ice core recovered from Greenland, the massive excursions of the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal - a proxy for air temperature - were considered a measurement error. But the correspondence of similar excursions measured on a different Greenland ice core and the coincidence of the most recent such excursion with a similar pattern found in the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal of carbonate in the lake sediment of Gerzensee (near Bern) (Oeschger et al. 1984) confirmed the robustness of these rapid climate change events in the past. Reflecting this, these rapid climate swings between about 80 and 10 ka BP were named Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Today, Dansgaard-Oeschger events are undersood to be oscillations of the Earth system that occurr without external triggers, but arise from the interaction of ocean and ice sheet dynamics, and are confined to Earth system states corresponding to the glacial periods of the late Pleistocene (Stocker and Johnsen 2003; Vettoretti et al. 2022).\nThe terrestrial biosphere was strongly affected by these large and rapid climate changes and left its imprints in several palaeo records (Figure 1.3). In response to the climate warming, atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations increased rapidly. Natural CH4 sources almost exclusively in land ecosystems (wetlands, fire). In parallel, the amount of dust transported to Greenland declined rapidly as climate warmed. This reflects an expansion of vegetation cover into dust-forming regions (e.g., deserts and peri-glacial areas). Also in parallel, nitrous oxide (N2O), another greenhouse gas, increased. This increase unfolded more gradually and reflects both oceanic and terrestrial sources. Furthermore, fire activity in the northern hemisphere, measured by charcoal deposits in Greenland ice cores, increased as the climate warmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Ice core and biomass burning records of Earth system changes during Dansgaard-Oeschger events - rapid climate change events during the last Glacial period, between 80 and 10 ka BP (kilo-years, 10\\(^{3}\\) years before present). Shading indicates significant patterns in the response of the time series to the events of abrupt warming and rapid cooling. (a) \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal is a proxy for air temperature. (b-f) Time series of reconstructed atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, dust and fire, temporally aligned and aggregated from subsets of the time series covering multiple Dansgaard-Oeschger events. BYRD: Byrd station, Antarctica; EDC: EPICA Dome C; NGRIP: North Greenland Ice Core Project. Figure from Arneth et al. (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variations in land-mediated greenhouse gases, dust, and fire are attest to the large and hemisphere-scale changes in terrestrial biosphere functioning in response to climate variations. Of course, greenhouse gases, dust, and fire-related emissions of CO2 and aerosols are radiative forcing agents themselves and thus affect the climate. These changes during Dansgaard-Oescher events therefore demonstrate the important role of the land biosphere in mediating Earth system changes.\nThe sources of multiple land-mediated greenhouse gases will be introduced in Chapter 11.\n\n\n1.1.4 Feedbacks\nLand ecosystems are a major sink for anthropogenic CO2. Between a quarter and a third of the C emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and by land use change is taken up again by land ecosystems (Chapter 3). This uptake flux partly buffers the anthropogenic disturbance of the Earth system. This is called a negative feedback (Chapter 13). Without it, the rise in atmospheric CO2 would be about 30-50% more rapid. The terrestrial carbon cycle is steered by a multitude of processes, operating at very different scales, and it is characterised by an enormous heterogeneity in space - across ecosystem types, climate and soil conditions. There is not just a single process responsible for this apparent negative global-scale climate-land biosphere feedback and the negative feedback is partly compensated by positive feedbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: An overview of physical and biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate system. (a) Synthesis of physical, biogeophysical and non-carbon dioxide (CO2) biogeochemical feedbacks that are included in the definition of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) assessed in this Technical Summary. These feedbacks have been assessed using multiple lines of evidence including observations, models and theory. The net feedback is the sum of the Planck response, water vapour and lapse rate, surface albedo, cloud, and biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. Bars denote the mean feedback values, and uncertainties representvery likely ranges; (b) Estimated values of individual biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. The atmospheric methane (CH4) lifetime and other non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks have been calculated using global Earth system model simulations from AerChemMIP, while the CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) source responses to climate have been assessed for the year 2100 using a range of modelling approaches using simplified radiative forcing equations. The estimates represent the mean and 5–95% range. The level of confidence in these estimates is lowowing to the large model spread. (c) Carbon-cycle feedbacks as simulated by models participating in the C4MIP of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). An independent estimate of the additional positive carbon-cycle climate feedbacks from permafrost thaw, which is not considered in most C4MIP models, is added. The estimates represent the mean and 5–95% range. Note that these feedbacks act through modifying the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and thus are not included in the definition of ECS, which assumes a doubling of CO2 , 4 but are included in the definition and assessed range of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE). {5.4.7, 5.4.8, Box 5.1, Figure 5.29, 6.4.5, Table 6.9, 7.4.2, Table 7.10}. Figure and caption text from the IPCC Assessment Report 6, Technical Summary, Figure TS.17 (Arias et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example for an important positive feedback arising from land biosphere processes is that of permafrost melting. As the climate warms, previously frozen soil that is very rich in organic matter content melts and the C becomes exposed to decomposers (heterotrophic soil bacteria and fungi). CO2 is produced. This climate warming-induced CO2 from melting permafrost amplifies the warming, which triggered it in the first place, due to its greenhouse effect - a positive feedback. Melting permafrost soil often becomes water-logged. The anaerobic conditions promote the production of methane (CH4) - an even stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. The positive feedback gets further amplified.\nThe land biosphere is connected with the Earth system through a multitude of positive and negative feedbacks, leading to complex interactions. While Earth System Models resolve many of these feedbacks and aid our understanding of the systems response to the anthropogenic forcing, translating these concepts into verbal and mental models of how climate change unfolds is challenging. A positive feedback is often described as a “vicious cycle” and sometimes vaguely conflated with a tipping point. A solid understanding of terrestrial biosphere processes, clear definitions, and a concise formalism, grounded on known physical relationships, helps to clarify concepts and the contextualization and communication of the risks of climate change. Chapter 13 will serve this purpose.\n\n\n1.1.5 Tipping points\nTipping points in the Earth system are points at which of a part of the Earth system transitions into a new state in response to a relatively small external forcing. They are inherently hard to predict using Earth System Models. Surprises cannot be excluded. Several potential tipping points have been identified in terrestrial systems (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022). Their reliable simulation in models relies on accurate models of processes in land ecosystems. Once more, land ecosystems and their response to climate change may be a critical element for the future of the Earth system. However, relatively large uncertainties remain for modelling key processes and further research is needed to consolidate the current understanding (and hand-drawn map) of potential tipping elements in the land biosphere (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The location of climate tipping elements in the cryosphere (blue), biosphere (green), and ocean/atmosphere (orange), and global warming levels at which their tipping points will likely be triggered. Figure and caption text from Armstrong McKay et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Carbon dixide removal through land ecosystems\nFor the climate to be stabilized at 1.5°C or 2.0°C, rapid and large CO2 emission cuts are needed. Alongside the reduction of fossil fuel combustion, climate stabilization scenarios rely - to a varying degree - on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Most CDR options deployed to date and available for scaling to meet climate stabilization needs rely on land ecosystems for sequestering (net uptake and long-term storage) additional C.  Afforestation and reforestation have been estimated to be a potent solution for climate change mitigation (Walker et al. 2022; Mo et al. 2023) and tree planting has moved to centre stage in the public perception and in policy efforts to avert dangerous climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Roles of CDR in global or national mitigation strategies. Stylised pathway showing multiple functions of CDR in different phases of ambitious mitigation: (1) further reducing net CO2 or GHG emissions levels in near-term; (2) counterbalancing residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions in the mid-term; (3) achieving and sustaining net-negative CO2 or GHG emissions in the long-term. Figure and caption text from IPCC Assessment Report 6, Working Group III, Cross-Chapter Box 8 (IPCC 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, ecological principles and multiple aspects of the role of land ecosystems and their interaction with climate and the carbon cycle have to be considered - apart from conflicts with biodiversity and sustainability goals and social, economic, and cultural aspects of land use (Deprez et al. 2024). For example, the carbon stored in a tree is susceptible to a range of threats, including wildfires, deforestation, and tree mortality by aggravating climatic stress (Anderegg et al. 2020). Moreover, surface properties, relevant for land-climate interactions, and their differences between forests and grasslands imply that forests may heat the local climate more than a grassland would - despite the additional C stored in a forest (Bala et al. 2007).\nUnderstanding the technical potential of land-based CDR will have to consider the full complexity of land-Earth system interactions. This course introduces these interactions.",

    "text": "2.1 A global view of vegetation\nWe start with the observation that the global distribution of plants and characteristic assemblies of different plant species is not random, but relates to climate. Around the beginning of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt pursued expeditions to different places on Earth and connected the multitude of his local observations into a global view of biogeography. He was the first to realize that vegetation zones along elevational gradients were shifted across different mountain ranges on different continents and located on different latitudes, and that the elevational and latitudinal patterns in vegetation were related to climate - in much the same way across the earth. This finding is visualised by the schematic scientific drawing in Figure 2.1. The figure illustrates, for example, that the treeline increases from the high northern latitudes of Lapland at 68\\(^\\circ\\)N to the Alps and Pyrenees at 42-46\\(^\\circ\\)N and to the Himalaya at 29-32\\(^\\circ\\)N. Or that the elevation at which Betula alba (birch) grows varies from 1000-2000 ft in Lapland, to 4000-5000 ft in the Alps, and about 15,000 ft in the Himalaya. Figure 2.1 also illustrates that the treeline doesn’t increase monotonically with decreasing latitude. Although not spelled out in the figure, this is a hint at the importance of water, along with temperature, for controlling vegetation. We’ll revisit this observation later in this book. Humboldt’s integration of globally distributed observations into his global view of climate as a driver of vegetation was pioneering and forms the basis of our modern approach to understanding and modelling global vegetation patterns and how they are influenced by climate change.\nFigure 2.1: Vegetation zones along elevation and latitude.

    "text": "2.2 Biomes\nToday’s geodata provides information on climate and vegetation properties with global coverage. This enables a global mapping of vegetation, filling in the blank spots between the local observations made by Alexander von Humboldt 200 years ago. Global patterns in the distribution of vegetation become apparent when grouping plants and plant functional types (see Section 2.2.2) into biomes or broad vegetation classes. A global map of biomes following the definition and global delineation by Olson et al. (2001) is given in Figure 2.2. The exact delineation and naming of biomes varies between different sources, but the main distinctions are shared among all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Fourteen biomes and the locations of sites representative for each biome (used below).\n\n\n\n\n\nEach biome is characterised by the types of dominant plants (plant functional types), their characteristics (traits), ecosystem structural and functional properties, and landscape processes (e.g., fire). Underlying all of this is the characteristic climate. The following biome classification (based on Bonan (2015) and slightly deviating from Olson et al. (2001)) can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClick on the biome names below to open a tab that lists some key characteristics and provides a Walter-Lieth climate diagram for a representative site, located in that biome. The sites are locations where ecoystem water and carbon fluxes, along with meteorological variables, are measured. We will revisit data from these same sites in later chapters, then with a focus on water and carbon fluxes and the phenology. The locations of the sites are indicated on the map in Figure 2.2.\nWalter-Lieth climate diagrams show monthly climatologies of average temperature and precipitation on the same axis and scaled such that months where the blue curve (precipitation, mm month-1) is above the red curve (temperature, \\(^\\circ\\)C) indicates humid periods and the opposite relative curve positions indicates dry periods.

Acknowledging their intricate relationship with climate, biomes can also be delineated in climate space - in a diagram defined by mean annual temperature (MAT) along one axis and mean annual precipitation (MAP) along the other axis. This yields a plot following Whittaker (1975). Note that the biome definition shown in Figure 2.12 does not exactly match the definition of biomes given above as it is mainly aimed at separating with respect to MAT and MAP. For example, Mediterranean forests are not separated in the “Whittaker-plot”. This is because their characteristic climate is not distinguished by annual means, but by the seasonality of temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# library(devtools)\n# devtools::install_github(\"valentinitnelav/plotbiomes\")\nlibrary(plotbiomes)\nplotbiomes::whittaker_base_plot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Biomes in climate space, defined by mean annual temperature and precipitation, following Whittaker (1975).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Plant functional types\nEach biome is characterised by a typical assembly of plant functional types (PFT). PFTs are a grouping of plant species based on their key physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics. That is, we can distinguish between annual (mostly grasses and herbs) and perennial (mostly trees and shrubs) plants, between needle-leaved and broadleaved trees, and between deciduous and evergreen trees. A key physiological distinction can further be made between grasses following the C3 vs. the C4 photosynthetic pathway (see Chapter 4). Thereby, the bewildering diversity of the plant kingdom can be reduced to a small set of PFT. A common categorization distinguishes the following PFTs:\n\nneedle-leaved evergreen trees\nbroadleaved evergreen trees\nneedle-leaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved annuals (herbs)\nC3 grasses\nC4 grasses\n\nGlobal vegetation models use PFTs as their basic unit for distinguishing plants. The exact delineation of PFTs implemented in such models may vary from the list given above. Further distinctions may be made and are relevant in a global vegetation and carbon cycle modelling context. For example, only a relatively small subset of plants are known to associate with symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules of the host plant (“N-fixing plants”, see also Chapter 10). This association is highly relevant for the N economy of the plant and its productivity and competitiveness under different levels of N availability.\nPlants can also be distinguished into the botanical classification of angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnnosperms (seed-producing plants that include conifers, cycads, and Ginkgo). The distinction between angiosperms and gymnosperms largely aligns with the distinction between needle-leaved and broadleaved plants (but see Ginkgo). The two groups are not only distinguished by their phylogenetic heritage, but also by essential characteristics that relate to the efficiency by which they photosynthesise and transpire water. Angiosperm leaves typically exhibit higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates and are thinner and shorter-lived than leaves of gymnosperms. These differences relate to differences in how the water transport system (plant hydraulics) is built. A larger number and a wider diameter of water transport organs in angiosperms enable a higher water conductivity - essential for sustaining higher photosynthetic rates than in gymnosperms.\n\n\n2.2.3 Traits\nThe physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics of different plants determine their productivity and competitiveness in a given climate. Such characteristics are referred to as plant functional traits, or often just traits. Plant species can be described by a set of traits and a subset of certain traits yields the distinction into PFTs described above: leaf habit (deciduous vs. evergreen), leaf form (needle-leaved vs. broadleaved), and the life history strategy distinguising annual vs. perennial. A range of additional traits are commonly described and investigated scientifically. Here, we will not consider additional ones. The concept of a plant functional trait is that it describes a largely immutable characteristic of a plant species that determines metabolic rates (photosynthesis, respiration) and their relationship to the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature), nutrient and water demand, and ultimately its demographic rates (growth, fecundity, mortality) and thus competitiveness.\nToday’s global distribution of species and biomes (assuming no intervention by human land use and forest management) is the outcome of competition and thus reflects the combination of plant functional traits that optimises competitiveness of a species under the present-day climate. The distribution of biomes and PFTs is thus a direct reflection of the climate.\nFor example, whether a region is dominated by deciduous or by evergreen trees and forests is determined by the benefits and costs for a plant of maintaining leaves year-round. Evergreen trees benefit from the ability to photosynthesise and gain carbon around the year. For example, in Mediterranean regions, although light levels are lower in winter than in summer, ample moisture and non-negligible light enables evergreen trees to assimilate carbon also during winter months. However, leaves and needles of evergreen plants have to be built for lasting several years. Such leaves are typically much thicker than those of deciduous trees and thus require more carbon per unit leaf area for their construction. The leaf mass per unit leaf area is commonly referred to as the leaf mass per area, LMA, and is an important additional plant trait as it is directly linked to a plant’s carbon balance. Over the leaf lifespan, the initial high construction costs of high-LMA leaves are outweighed by the additional carbon assimilation during periods when deciduous trees shed their leaves.\nLeaf-shedding of deciduous trees, in contrast, is a strategy to avoid having to build costly long-lasting leaves and maintaining them year-round (which also incurs an additional respiration cost, also in the form of carbon). Leaves are shed during periods when the climate is unfavourable for photosynthesis - during cold and dark winter months, or during excessively dry periods.\nNote that plant functional traits are often not entirely immutable. Instead, traits may vary also within a species and these variations are often driven by the environment. This is called acclimation. Such variations can even arise over the course of a season. For example, photosynthetic traits can rapidly acclimate to the large changes in light availability over the course of a year. Some traits are more plastic than others. For example, a tree is either needle-leaved or broadleaved. There is no continuum between the two leaf forms. In contrast, the nitrogen content per unit leaf mass is relatively plastic within a species.\nA changing environment changes the competitiveness of a given species, i.e., of a given trait combination. As a result, some traits may acclimate to some extent within a weeks to years. Over longer time scales, the altered demographic rates in a new climate affect the competitiveness of a species (even after some of its traits may have acclimated to a new climate) and ultimately shift demographic rates and the community composition. In grasslands, where the demographic cycle is short, such community composition changes may unfold over time scales of a few years. In forests, the longevity of an individual tree is on the order of decades to centuries and community composition changes unfold on correspondingly long time scale.",

    "text": "2.3 Global vegetation patterns\nThe biome classification is a way to discretize vegetation based on several characteristics (e.g., tree cover fraction). However, many of these characteristics describe observable variables that vary more or less gradually across environmental gradients and each of these variables can be mapped across the globe thanks to Earth observation data. These global patterns of different observable variables reflect how the climate influences vegetation structure and functioning across the globe (independent of a classification into biomes). In much of the remainder of this course, we will investigate these vegetation-climate relationships without considering the biome classification. These relationships are informative for understanding how different processes of terrestrial ecology, plant physiology, the carbon cycle, and land-climate interactions are driven by the environment and vary across the globe.\n\nVegetation heightLeaf area indexBiomassTree cover fraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: The global distribution of vegetation height from Simard et al.

Therefore, the pixels for which data is used for visualising the vegetation height per biome is biased towards particularly tall vegetation in these areas. Consequently, the distribution of vegetation heights in the biome ‘Tundra’ appears implausibly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Annual maximum leaf area index, averaged over years 2000-2008.

A widely used distinction of vegetation types/land cover classes is that of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP, see Table 2.1). Vegetation types distinguish what can be seen from space and are thus amenable to remote-sensing based land cover classification. However, for example, different types of evergreen broadleaved forests are not distinguished (e.g., moist tropical, Mediterranean, and temperate evergreen broadleaved forests). Also, vegetation types/land cover classes distinguish land cover that is dominated by human activities (agricultural and urban), while biomes distinguish naturally occurring (i.e., without human influence) vegetation zones.

    "text": "2.5 Climate zones\nWhile the biome categorisation is based on plant functional types and reflects a mix of vegetation types and climate, the categorisation into vegetation types is independent of climate, but purely based on vegetation and land cover properties that can be sensed from space. In contrast to this approach, we may focus exclusively on the climate and distinguish climate zones. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Köppen 1884) is based on a hierarchical classification that separates climate based on the seasonality of monthly air temperature and precipitation. The climate zones are chosen such that they largely align with the biomes. For this, water availability during the main vegetation periods and temperature minima during winter and maxima during summer are recognized to be particularly influential for the composition of the vegetation and are considered for the Köppen-Geiger climate classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.21: Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria. Taken from Beck et al. (2018) and adapted from Peel, Finlayson, and McMahon (2007).

    "text": "2.6 Hillslope-scale heterogeneity\nTopography shapes microclimates and drives small-scale variations in hydrology. In mountain regions, vegetation may thus vary strongly along small spatial scales - on the order of 10-103 m. This scale - from the river channel to the ridge - is referred to as the hillslope scale. In much the same way as climate drives vegetation across biomes, so it does across the hillslope scale. The incident solar radiation and - as a consequence of that - near-surface air temperatures are affected by the local slope, aspect, and shading by the surrounding topography. Soil moisture and the groundwater table depth are affected by lateral subsurface flow of water, driven by gradients in water potentials along topographical gradients. Subsurface water flow converges in depressions and concave terrain (e.g., in valley bottoms) and diverges in convex terrain. (e.g., on ridges and hilltops). As a consequence, the water table is shallow in valley bottoms and deep under ridges. Radiation and hydrology thus create microclimates and plant water availability conditions that are shaped by topography and variations in vegetation that are shaped by the microclimates and hydrological conditions.\nThese hillslope-scale variations “intersect” with the the background climate (average climate across larger spatial scales, on the order of 104-105 m). A shallow groundwater table and moist soils in valley bottoms can promote plant productivity in arid regions and seasons. In contrast, in a humid climate, a very shallow water table in valley bottoms inhibits plant productivity due to anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils and the inability of roots to penetrate into permanently water-saturated soil. Similarly, the influence of radiation in promoting versus inhibiting plant productivity depends on the background climate. In cold climates of the high northern latitudes, the solar zenith angle is relatively also, even in mid-summer. This creates a strong influence of the local slope and aspect. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive more radiation - a difference to north-facing slopes that can be critical for sustaining tree growth in high northern regions. In contrast, elevated incident solar radiation in south-facing slopes can aggravate water limitation and suppress vegetation productivity in more arid climates of the subtropics and mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.23: Hillslope effects on vegetation in different background climate zones.

Figure extracted from Fan et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate also varies along elevation due to thermodynamics and radiative transfer in the atmosphere - independent of the slope and aspect of the local terrain. Temperatures decline following the lapse rate in the troposphere, leading to a shift of vegetation zones along large elevational gradients. This phenomenon is depicted also in Humboldt’s drawings (Figure 2.1). Radiation levels are elevated at high altitudes due to a shorter path length of solar radiation travelling across the atmosphere and, consequently, a reduced attenuation of the radiation intensity. Atmospheric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen declines with elevation. This implies reduced respiration and an increased efficiency of photosynthesis.\nSmall-scale variations in vegetation may also be driven my variations in soil characteristics and bedrock lithology which influences drainage and soil chemistry (pH, nutrient availability). Where the ground is seasonally snow-covered, very small-scale terrain features (100-102) and dominant wind directions drive snow accumulation and dispersion, leading to substantial small-scale variations in maximum snow depth and the duration of seasonal snow cover - with implications for plants (Körner and Hiltbrunner 2021).",

    "text": "2.7 Species distribution modelling and ecological niche\nThe notion that climate drives vegetation and the distribution of plant species enables a prediction and mapping of the species occurrence across geographical space. Data on species presence and absence can be associated with multiple variables characterizing the abiotic environment (mostly climate) recorded for the same location. The resulting empirical patterns can be used for spatial modelling and predicting whether a species is likely to occur at a new location or even a novel climate Figure 2.24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.24: Methodological approach to species distribution modelling and predicting to a novel climate. Figure from Svenning et al. (2011).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach to species distribution modelling is fundamentally rooted in the ecological niche concept. As formulated by Hutchinson (1957; Araújo and Guisan 2006), each species has a fundamental niche that can be conceived as a domain in a multi-dimensional space defined by the environmental conditions. Environmental filtering yields the fundamental niche. The actual, or realized niche is smaller as it is additionally constrained by competition with other species. Natural selection yields the realized niche. Several challenges for species distribution modelling exist (Zimmermann et al. 2010). For example, the species distribution is hardly ever in equilibrium with the environment, given that climate has been constantly changing (although not as rapidly as today for millions of years); topographic heterogeneity, climatic history, and ecological refugia affect the species distribution and how it varies under climate change; genetic adaptation can lead to populations within species that exhibit different responses to the environment; and niche stability over long time scales may be undermined not only by genetic adaptation, but also by physiological effects of CO2 which fundamentally alters photosynthesis and transpiration and will therefore shift water availability-related niche limits observed today.",

    "section": "2.8 Temporal variations of vegetation",
    "text": "2.8 Temporal variations of vegetation\nSpatial patterns in vegetation are influenced by how climate varies across different areas. Similarly, changes in vegetation are influenced by how climate changes over time. Vegetation change at temporal scales of thousands of years is recorded, for example, by pollen deposited in layered sediments. Given that they are preserved and that the sediment layers can be dated, the vegetation composition over time can be reconstructed. An example is given for the Moossee, near Bern in Figure 2.25. The pollen diagram documents how vegetation on the Swiss Plateau unterwent several major changes since the last Glacial. At around 19 kyr BP, a steppe tundra established, replaced around 16 kyr BP by a shrub tundra. At around 15 kyr BP, a boreal forest established before it was replaced by a temperate mixed oak forest at the beginning of the Holocene - the current warm period at 11,600 yr BP. A beech-dominated temperate forest, as it is common for this region today, established around 8200 yr BP. Figure 2.25 also shows that these biome replacements coincided with rapid climatic shifts and that the vegetation change was largely instantaneous. This instantaneous response of species composition is interpreted as a reflection of the importance of glacial refugia from which a species may rapidly expand upon climate change (Rey et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.25: Pollen diagram from the Moossee, Switzerland. The diagram shows the percentage of pollen recorded over time (green areas). Cultural indicators and charcoal influx indicate the presence of humans in the region. Parallel variations observed from other data sources are also shown for interpretation: Millennial-scale variations in solar radiation, lake levels, and temperature reconstructions. Figure from Rey et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple vegetation reconstructions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) obtained from globally distributed locations provide a picture of how biomes were distributed across the Earth around 20 ka BP (Figure 2.26, bottom panel). The difference in climate and CO2 (global mean temperatures were around 6°C lower than at present; CO2 was at around 180 ppm, today it’s at over 420 ppm) caused forest biomes to recede and grasslands to expand across most of the globe. The upper panel of Figure 2.26 shows the simulated biome distribution. These simulation results are not based on a species distribution model, but on a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model that accounts for both climate and CO2 effects and simulates the distribution of PFTs from which biomes were derived here. The simulation of vegetation distribution at the level of PFTs instead of species is less affected by biotic interactions that are hard to simulate at global scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.26: The global distribution of biomes at the Last Glacial Maximum.

    "text": "3.1 The pre-industrial carbon cycle\nCarbon is an abundant element, present in all organic matter - matter produced by biota (living organisms) - and in inorganic forms in the atmosphere, the ocean, and the lithosphere. On land, the vast majority of C is present in organic forms in living biomass - mostly of vegetation (450 PgC) and soil organic matter (1700 PgC excluding permafrost). Of the latter, a particularly large stock of C is stored in permafrost soils (1200 PgC). In the ocean, the vast majority of C mass is present in inorganic forms, dissolved in ocean water, of which 900 PgC is stored in the surface ocean (the well-mixed top few hundred meters) and 37,100 PgC is stored in the deep ocean. Dissolved organic carbon in the ocean makes up 700 PgC and 1750 PgC are stored as carbonate shells in ocean floor sediments. In the pre-industrial Earth, 591 PgC were present as CO2 in the atmosphere.\nFigure 3.1: Global carbon (CO2) budget (2010–2019). Yellow arrows represent annual carbon fluxes (in PgC yr-1) associated with the natural carbon cycle, estimated for the time prior to the industrial era, around 1750. Pink arrows represent anthropogenic fluxes averaged over the period 2010–2019. The rate of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is equal to net land-use change emissions, including land management plus fossil fuel emissions, minus land and ocean net sinks (plus a small budget imbalance). Circles with yellow numbers represent pre-industrial carbon stocks in PgC. Circles with pink numbers represent anthropogenic changes to these stocks (cumulative anthropogenic fluxes) since 1750. The relative change of gross photosynthesis since pre-industrial times is based on 15 Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. The corresponding emissions by total respiration and fire are those required to match the net land flux, exclusive of net land-use change emissions which are accounted for separately. The cumulative change of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of carbon cumulatively lost by net land-use change emissions, and net carbon accumulated since 1750 in response to environmental drivers (warming, rising CO2, nitrogen deposition). Figure from Canadell et al. (2021).\nUnder the relatively stable climate of the pre-industrial Holocene (11,700 yr BP - 1750 CE), the size of the C pools described above remained relatively stable. To simplify, we can conceive them as constant (at steady state) under the pre-industrial Holocene climate. This is a simplification. For example, millennial-scale trends in solar radiation inputs over the seasons and latitudes (driven by slight changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun), caused climate and vegetation changes that were substantial and in certain cases abrupt (e.g., the demise of the Green Sahara between around 6-3 ka BP (Shanahan et al. 2015)).\nEven under such a pre-industrial steady state, C fluxes between the major reservoirs or pools (atmosphere, ocean, land) persisted. This is indicated in Figure 3.1 by the wide orange arrows pointing up and down between the land and the atmosphere and between the ocean and the atmosphere, as well as between different pools within the ocean. In a steady state, the C flux from the atmosphere into the land roughly equals the flux from the land to the atmosphere, and the net exchange flux is zero. Hence, the pool sizes remain constant in spite of the ongoing exchange fluxes between them. We speak of a dynamic equilibrium.",

    "text": "3.2 Carbon pool dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1st-order decay model\n\n\n\nThe concept of pools and fluxes is central for describing and modelling the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles in the environment. The dynamics of a pool \\(C(t)\\) is given by the balance of the flux of C into that pool \\(I(t)\\) and the flux \\(O(t)\\) leaving the pool - over time \\(t\\). In general terms, we can write the temporal change of the pool size as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I(t) - O(t) \\;.\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nTo simplify the expressions, we will omit \\((t)\\) below. But remember, that the fluxes and pools vary with time. The assumption that the out-flux \\(O\\) scales linearly with the size of the pool \\(C\\) is a good simplifying description (i.e., a model) for many processes in the environment. For example, the amount of CO2 produced by the decomposition (decay) of organic matter in the soil scales roughly linearly with the amount of organic matter that is being respired. This leads to the 1st-order decay model of pool dynamics:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - kC \\;.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Here, \\(k\\) is a decay constant and is in units of the inverse of time. In other words, it specifies the fraction of \\(C\\) decaying per unit time (e.g,. seconds, or years). The higher \\(k\\), the more rapidly the pool decays. For the case of \\(I=0\\), we get \\(\\mathrm{d}C/\\mathrm{d}t = -kC\\). This is a differential equation and can be understood as: What is the function that yields itself, multiplied by \\(-k\\), when taking its derivative with respect to time? The solution is:\n\\[\nC(t) = C_0 \\; e^{-kt} \\;.\n\\] For example, following this model, the pool of C in soil organic matter would decay exponentially if inputs (litterfall) were zero. The decay constant \\(k\\) determines how long it takes for it to be reduced by a certain factor. A commonly used factor is 0.5. We can calculate a half-life - the time \\(t\\) at which \\(C(t) = 0.5\\;C_0\\).\nIn a dynamic equilibrium the change in the pool size \\(C\\) is by definition zero. \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \\;.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Combining Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3 and re-arranging terms leads to the steady-state pool size as a function of the in-flux and the decay constant \\(k\\). \\[\nC^\\ast = I/k\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Here, the asterisk denotes that \\(C\\) is at steady-state. This solution indicates two aspects. First, the size of the steady-state pool is proportional to the input flux. Note that we assumed that the input flux itself has no dependency on \\(C\\). Second, the size of the steady-state pool is inversely proportional to the decay constant. That is, the faster the decay, the smaller the steady state pool.\nEquation 3.2 can also be expressed in terms of an average lifetime or turnover time \\(\\tau\\), instead of \\(k\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - C/\\tau \\;.\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nConsider the C pool of the intermediate and deep sea (37,100 PgC) in Figure 3.1 (bottom right). What is the turnover time of C in that pool?\nExpress the steady-state pool size \\(C^\\ast\\) as a function of the in-flux and the turnover time \\(\\tau\\).\nExpress the half-life constant as a function of \\(k\\).\nDo you know about other processes in nature that can be described by the 1st-order decay model?\n\n\n\nWith the information in Figure 3.1 about pool sizes and steady-state gross fluxes (parallel input and output fluxes), and our model of pool dynamics, we get an insight about how fast C is cycling in and out of different pools. \\(k=I/C^\\ast\\) is a measure of this cycling rate. Or expressed in terms of its inverse, the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) measures how long a C atom resides in that pool. Table 3.1 documents the turnover times for major pools of the global carbon cycle. The small C burial fluxes into sediments on land and on the ocean floor are the supply of what is eventually converted into the very large pool of C in carbonate rock (limestone). A small fraction of the C burial flux is in the form of organic matter, including dead plants, algae, and other microorganisms. Under high heat and pressure, a fraction of it contributes to the formation of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas - fossil fuels. The discrepancy in turnover times between the lithosphere C pool and the other pools indicates that C cycles on vastly different time scales and the slow geological C cycle is largely disconnected from “fast” C cycle between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. Reflecting this discrepancy in time scales, the geological C cycle is not depicted in Figure 3.1 and C in fossil fuel reservoirs is treated as an external input to the fast C cycle.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Pre-industrial pool sizes, input fluxes, and turnover times of major pools of the global carbon cycle. The preindustrial input flux into the atmosphere is calculated as the sum of fluxes from volcanism, total respiration and fire, freshwater, and ocean-atmosphere gas exchange from Figure 3.1. The input flux into the surface ocean is the sum of ocean-atmosphere gas exchange and the flux from intermediate and deep sea. The flux from marine biota is not additional to the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux. The pool size of the biosphere is taken as the sum of vegetation and soils. The permafrost C pool is relatively inert. The size of the lithosphere C pool includes C in the form of sedimentary (carbonate) rocks and kerogens (solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks). Its estimate is based on Falkowski et al. (2000). The input flux into the lithosphere is calculated as the sum of burial on land, rock weathering, and ocean floor sedimentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPool\nPool size (PgC)\nInput flux (PgC yr-1)\nTurnover time (yr)\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n591\n167.3\n3.5\n\n\nSurface ocean\n900\n329\n2.7\n\n\nDeep ocean\n37,000\n(see exercise 3.1)\n(see exercise 3.1)\n\n\nBiosphere\n2150\n113\n19\n\n\nLithosphere\n75,000,000\n0.7\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) describes the average time that an atom of C resides in the respective pool. This is a simplification. In the C pool ‘terrestrial biosphere’, not every C atom has the same probability of being oxidized and respired as CO2. Hence, in reality, \\(\\tau\\) is a wide distribution, ranging from seconds to years for non-structural carbon derived from photosynthesis, decades to centuries for C in woody biomass, and to millennia for a small fraction of soil organic matter, especially if the C is protected from oxidation, for example in water-logged soils. The turnover time should therefore be understood as a diagnostic, useful for describing the average systems dynamics in a simplified way, and subsuming multiple processes that operate at different time scales, contributing to different portions of C conversion to CO2.\nThe range of turnover times (e.g., within the terrestrial biosphere) arise because C is transferred between multiple pools within the biosphere and the ocean. Going to the next more detailed level of abstraction (model representation), multiple C pools in terrestrial ecosystems can be distinguished (e.g., non-structural C, leaves, roots, wood, litter, soil organic matter, microbes). Some C “cascades” through multiple pools, some is quickly respired back into the atmosphere. The interpretation that \\(k\\) equals the inverse of the turnover time \\(\\tau\\), and that the turnover time equals the mean age of all C atoms in that pool, and that the mean transit time (the time it takes between an atom of C entering a pool until it exits that pool again) equals \\(\\tau\\) is only valid for certain cases, and not for “C cascades” with fluxes between multiple pools. Requirements are that we’re dealing with a single well-mixed pool, that this pool is at steady-state, that it has been so for an infinitely long time, that \\(I\\) and \\(k\\) are constant over time, and the flux leaving the pool is a linear function of the pool size (\\(O=kC\\)) (Sierra et al. 2017). The transit time is the same as residence time - a term used more commonly in hydrology.",

    "section": "3.3 The anthropogenic perturbation",
    "text": "3.3 The anthropogenic perturbation\nAlthough fossil fuels are formed by natural processes of the C cycle, their combustion can be regarded as an external input of C into the (modern) global C cycle. This is because the time scale at which the reservoir of fossil fuels is depleted (102 yr) stands in stark contrast to the time scale at which it was formed (108 yr, see turnover time of C in the lithosphere in Table 3.1). The C is added in the form of CO2 to the atmosphere from where it is taken up by the ocean through diffusion and equilibration of the ocean surface water’s CO2 partial pressure with the atmosphere’s CO2 partial pressure, and by the terrestrial biosphere through photosynthesis. It is important to note that CO2 in the atmosphere does not decay through physical or chemical processes, nor are there C sinks on land or in the ocean that remove C away from the “fast” C cycle - except the burial into sediments (see Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1). However the magnitude of the burial fluxes are dwarfed by the magnitude of C inputs through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Hence, the present-day C emissions drive an accumulation of the total amount of C cycling in the “fast” C cycle and the added C gets redistributed between the spheres. The net fluxes from the atmosphere into land ecosystems and the ocean arise because the total terrestrial and oceanic C pools are increasing as CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere and the atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising. In subsequent chapters (Chapter 4 and Chapter 7), we will learn about the processes driving the CO2 uptake by land and ocean and the dynamics of the C redistribution in the Earth system. In this chapter, we will look at the global C budget - how much C has been emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation and how much of this C has accumulated in the atmosphere and how much has been taken up by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere?\nThe global C budget can be defined for globally aggregated fluxes as the balance between emissions from fossil fuels \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) and land use change \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) on the left side of the equation and the redistribution of C among the atmosphere, land and ocean. \\(G_\\mathrm{atm}\\) is the atmospheric growth rate, \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) is the net ocean C uptake (also referred to as the ocean sink) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is the net land C uptake (or land sink). A net flux from the atmosphere into the ocean or into land C storage is positive.\n\\[\nE_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} = G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nThis terminology is adopted from the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2023) and is expressed as global annual total fluxes. The separation of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is not straight-forward, but can be understood in a simplified fashion as spatially separated fluxes, whereby the land sink occurs only on areas that are not affected by land use change (LUC). In reality, LUC affects the land sink which complicates a separation of the two components. This is further resolved in Chapter 14.\nThe values of the global carbon budget components are given in Figure 3.1 for an average across years 2010-2019, where \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) corresponds to the ‘net ocean flux’ and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) corresponds to the the ‘net land flux’ in Figure 3.1. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) corresponds to ‘net land-use change’. The ‘net’ indicates that \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) is the net effect between CO2 emissions from deforestation and C uptake by re-growing forests and afforestations. Note that the annual atmospheric growth rate is not resolved in Figure 3.1. The most recent update of the global carbon budget from Friedlingstein et al. (2023) is given in Table 3.2 as 10-year averages of annual fluxes for years 2013-2022 and cumulative fluxes for the industrial era - years 1750-2022.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Global carbon budget (in PgC and PgC yr-1) from the 2023 update by Friedlingstein et al.

Values reported by Friedlingstein et al. (2023) include the cement carbonation sink. Without that sink, the value of \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) for 2022 would be about 0.2 PgC yr-1 higher. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) estimates are based on land-use and land-use change data from national statistics and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. These models use information about vegetation C stocks, forest C re-growth curves, and the fate of C after deforestation and harvesting (e.g., wood products lifetime). Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly and bears the least uncertainty among all carbon budget components. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean CO2 uptake models and observation-based products. In Friedlingstein et al. (2023), the land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models.\nAdvances in observations and modelling in recent years now enable the land and ocean sink to be estimated in a “bottom-up fashion” - using models of land and ocean C uptake. Since every component of the global carbon budget is thereby estimated independently, a budget imbalance term \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) can be defined. A value of zero indicates that models of the land and ocean C uptake exactly match the (better known) emission terms minus the atmospheric growth rate. \\[\nB_\\mathrm{IM} = E_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} - (G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land})\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nToday, the global carbon budget is well specified thanks to reliable estimates of its individual components. The budget imbalance is only a small fraction of the total emissions. Until recently, “bottom-up” estimates of \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) by land C cycle models were deemed insufficient for providing reliable estimates. Instead, \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) was estimated as the budget residual by neglecting \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) and rearranging terms in Equation 3.7 to solve for \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\). In fact, when the IPCC First Assessment Report was published in 1990, the existence of C sink on land was not known and it was treated as a budget imbalance and referred to as the ‘missing sink’. It is stated that “there are possible processes on land which could account for the missing CO2 (but it has not been possible to verify them)”.\nIt was only later that the existence of a terrestrial C sink could be more firmly established and quantified thanks to parallel measurements of the atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations (Keeling, Piper, and Heimann 1996). (In fact, the ratio O2/N2 is measured to avoid the much larger measurement uncertainty in absolute O2 measurements). The ratios of O2:CO2 are known from the stoichiometric molecular formulae for photosynthesis (O2:CO2 = 1.1), fossil fuel combustion (O2:CO2 = 1.4) and ocean uptake (O2:CO2 = 0). An ocean O2 source from marine organisms has to be factored in. Given the total C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, the net land C balance can thus be calculated and the calculation visualized geometrically (Figure 3.2). Note that net emissions from land use change are not considered and the “land sink” in Figure 3.2 is the net of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) in Equation 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Global land and ocean carbon sinks deduced from changes in atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentrations. The figure is an updated version of Fig. 2 from Keeling, Piper, and Heimann (1996), taken from a recent update of the atmospheric carbon and oxygen budget by Li et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a mathematical sense, the constraint from atmospheric oxygen can be understood as a second equation, necessary for solving for two unknowns \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\). Their sum must equal (well-known) emissions \\(E_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) minus the atmospheric growth rate \\(G_\\mathrm{atm}\\). This yields only one equation - that for the C budget (Equation 3.6). The oxygen budget provides a second equation and thus enables solving for two unknowns. In a similar fashion, the isotopic composition of C (the ratio of 13C:12C) also provides a second equation (Joos and Bruno 1998). The history of 13C can be measured on ice cores and \\((S_\\mathrm{land} - E_\\mathrm{LUC})\\) can thus be reconstructed for the past (Figure 3.3). Note that in order to separate \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) from the budget, independent estimates of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Top panel: Cumulative C uptake by the land biosphere over the past 11 kyr. The grey shaded area indicates uncertainty from ice core measurements. Bottom panel: Atmospheric CO2 concentration (grey squares and modelled atmospheric CO2 based on scenarios of drivers of past millennial-scale C cycle changes (green: land biosphere is the only driver, black: land biopshere, combined with effects by oceanic carbonate chemistry due to Holocene land C uptake, red: land biosphere, combined with effects by oceanic carbonate chemistry due to Holocene and pre-Holocene land C uptake). Figure from Elsig et al. (2009).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can adopt the perspective of C cycle science stated in earlier publications. Falkowski et al. (2000) wrote: “Direct determination of changes in terrestrial carbon storage has proven extremely difficult. Rather, the contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon storage is inferred from changes in the concentrations of atmospheric gases, especially CO2 and O2 […].” In that sense, let’s consider the land sink to be the budget residual and assume that the ocean sink estimate is accurate (indeed, its uncertainty is only about half the uncertainty in bottom-up land sink estimates, Table 3.2). Visually contrasting emissions and their redistribution reveals an interesting pattern (Figure 3.4). The substantial year-to-year (interannual) variations in the land sink are almost exclusively responsible for interannual variations in the atmospheric growth rate. Total emissions and the ocean sink exhibit little interannual variation. By definition, the sum of the atmospheric growth rate, land and ocean sink is equal to the sum of emissions from fossil fuels and land use change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUse Equation 3.7 to express the land sink as the budget residual (assuming \\(B_\\mathrm{IM} = 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Data from Friedlingstein et al. 2023.

    "text": "3.4 Understanding the land C sink\n\n3.4.1 Processes\nAs challenging as it was to locate the “missing C sink” in the terrestrial biosphere in the 1990s (see above), it remains a great challenge to locate the C sink within the terrestrial biosphere and attribute it to processes. Three processes are considered to be particularly influential for the terrestrial C balance, and they each affect ecosystems’ C balances in different regions across the globe - land use change, the relief of temperature limitations on photosynthesis and growth, and the CO2 fertilization effect.\nThe land C balance from land use change is the net of a flux to the atmosphere due to deforestation and a flux from the atmosphere to the land biosphere due to regrowth after deforestation. Land use change trends are very different across regions globally. While large C losses due to land use change are currently occurring in the tropics, northern extra-tropical regions generally gain C as forests are recovering from more intense wood harvesting in the past - prior the the mid-20th century. Chapter 14 delves deeper into the role of land use change on the carbon cycle and climate. The net C flux from land use change is accounted for in the global carbon budget by the term \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) (Equation 3.6) and should reflect also effects by C accumulation in recovering forests. However, past land use changes are uncertain and the impact of pre-1950 wood harvesting in temperate regions may be underestimated by models that supply estimates for \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\). \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\), when defined as the budget residual, may thus be driven by the C sink in recovering forests. A recent estimate suggests that about a quarter of the land sink, or 1.3 PgC yr-1, is due to recovery from past forest disturbances (fire, wind, and wood harvesting) (Pugh et al. 2019).\nWarming trends due to anthropogenic climate change are relieving temperature limitations on photosynthesis and tree growth, enabling an extension of the growing season (Ruehr et al. 2023), and an expansion of forest areas and vegetation greenness in high northern latitudes - as sensed from space (T. F. Keenan and Riley 2018). The associated land C sink, as the one driven by forest recovery from past land use change, is located in the northern extra-tropics.\nRising atmospheric CO2 stimulates leaf-level photosynthetic rates. The additional C assimilated likely drives increases in ecosystem C storage. However, a multitude of processes and ecosystem feedbacks are involved and affect the link between the leaf-level CO2-fertilization of photosynthesis and ecosystem-level C storage (nutrient limitation, tree longevity reduction due to accelerated growth, soil organic C loss due to plant-soil interactions). Free-Air-CO2-Experiments, where plots of outdoor growing vegetation are exposed to elevated CO2 during multiple years indicate a stimulation of photosynthesis and growth, but evidence for gains in biomass and soil C stocks is mixed. Yet, C gains in mature forest growth, biomass, and ecosystem C stocks are documented and, particularly in the tropics, CO2-fertilization appears to be the main driver of this trend. This is consistent with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models that attribute about 60-85% of the total land sink to CO2-fertilization (Schimel, Stephens, and Fisher 2015; Trevor F. Keenan et al. 2016). Published review studies (Ruehr et al. 2023; Walker et al. 2021) provide a more detailed account of the complex role of CO2-fertilization in driving the land C sink.\nTheory suggests that the CO2 effect on photosynthesis should be higher under warm than under cold temperatures. Therefore, a CO2-driven land sink should be strongest in the tropics. As mentioned above, a C sink that is driven predominantly by either growing season extensions and cold limitation reliefs or by recovery from past land use change would be located mainly in the northern extra-tropics. How to discriminate between these drivers and their associated C sink regions? Once more, atmospheric CO2 measurements provide a constraint. While the total terrestrial C sink is relatively well-constrained through the global carbon budget, contributions from the tropics (and southern hemisphere) vs. the northern extra-tropics requires an additional constraint. Atmospheric CO2 measurements, in combination with known CO2 sources and their location and with atmospheric transport fields (atmospheric inversions) enable a split of the global land C sink into contribution from the two regions, while their sum is constrained by the global carbon budget. This approach is visualized in Figure 3.5. The combination of the two constraints indicates that model simulations where the CO2-fertilization effect was “turned off” tend to be outside the range of plausible combinations of tropical and northern-extratropical land C sinks. This indicates the importance of a strong CO2-fertilization-driven C sink in the tropics. Hence, the hypothesis that the land C sink is driven exclusively by forest recovery from past land use and the extension of the growing season in cold-limited regions of the northern extra-tropics is not compatible with the C budget and the inter-hemispheric split of land C uptake inferred from atmospheric inversions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: The anti-correlation of the northern extra-tropical and the tropical-plus-southern land C sink. Atmospheric inversions from different sources (red and purple points and squares) indicate an anti-correlation of the regional sinks, constrained by the C mass balance from the global carbon budget: The sum of regional land C sinks must equal the total terrestrial C sink from the global carbon budget. Several Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) without the CO2-fertilisation effect (white triangles) lie outside the range constrained by the global C mass balance, while DGVMs with the CO2-fertilisation effect considered are better compatible with the budget. Figure from Schimel, Stephens, and Fisher (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe processes for understanding the oceanic C sink will be introduced in Chapter 7.\n\n\n3.4.2 Interannual variability\nAs highlighted above, pointing to Figure 3.4, the magnitude of the land C sink varies strongly between years. Semi-arid regions, where dry conditions during a substantial part of the year limit photosynthesis and where drought-related disturbances strongly influence ecosystem C balances, are contributing most strongly to the signal apparent from the global C budget (Ahlström et al. 2015). Semi-arid regions largely align with temperate and tropical grasslands, savannahs, and shrubland biomes (Figure 2.2). Years with a small land sink and a high atmospheric CO2 growth rate are dry years, associated with low global-scale terrestrial water storage (Humphrey et al. 2018), and are associated with warm temperature anomalies in the tropics (Cox et al. 2013). This indicates two important points. First, C storage in the terrestrial biosphere is highly susceptible to climate variations. Second, water availability has a strong control on the terrestrial carbon cycle. We will learn more about how the water and the carbon cycles are coupled in Chapter 8 and how the influence of water availability on vegetation varies across the globe in Chapter 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 trajectories and the land C cycle response\n\n\n\nEquation 3.2 describes the dynamics of land C storage based on a 1-box model. Let’s apply this model for understanding the link between changes in \\(I\\) and the land C balance (\\(\\mathrm{d}C/\\mathrm{d}t\\)). We explore different future trajectories of atmospheric CO2, branching off from its observed history, and simulate the resulting total terrestrial photosynthetic CO2 uptake (also referred to as the gross primary productivity, see also Chapter 4), the terrestrial C pool, and the land sink (i.e., the temporal change in the terrestrial C pool).\nWe make the (strong) assumption that the land C balance dynamics are exclusively driven by the CO2-fertilization effect on photosynthetic C uptake, represented by \\(I\\), while the turnover rate (\\(\\tau\\)) remains constant. The CO2-fertilization effect on a variable \\(x\\) is commonly measured as the sensitivity factor \\(\\beta\\): \\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\ln (x/x_0)}{\\ln (c_a/c_{a,0})}\n\\tag{3.8}\\] Here, \\(c_a\\) is the atmospheric CO2 concentration (ambient CO2). For ratios of \\(x/x_0\\) and \\(c_a/c_{a,0}\\) approaching 1, Equation 3.8 is equivalent to the ratio of the relative change in \\(x\\) over the relative change in CO2. \\[\n\\beta \\approx \\frac{\\Delta x/x}{\\Delta c_a/c_a}\\;,\n\\tag{3.9}\\] where \\(\\Delta x = x - x_0\\). The sensitivity of the total terrestrial photosynthetic CO2 uptake to atmospheric CO2 has been estimated by T. F. Keenan et al. (2023) as \\(\\beta = 0.59 \\pm 0.16\\). With this, we can model \\(I\\) as a function of \\(c_a\\) using Equation 3.9.\nThe 1-box model can be implemented numerically by discretization in time (i.e., considering time steps \\(\\Delta t\\)). To simulate the terrestrial C pool over time (\\(C(t)\\)), Equation 3.2 can thus be written as \\[\nC(t+\\Delta t) = C(t) + I(t) - \\tau^{-1}C(t)\n\\]\nWe further assume that \\(C(t)\\) was at steady-state in year 1850 - the first year of the CO2 time series used here. \\(\\tau\\) could be estimated by using values of terrestrial C pools (sum of vegetation C and soil C) and the gross photosynthesis flux from Figure 3.1 (\\(\\tau = (450\\; \\mathrm{GtC} + 1700\\; \\mathrm{GtC})/113\\; \\mathrm{GtC\\;yr}^{-1} = 19.0 \\; \\mathrm{yr}\\)). However, the resulting land C sink would be strongly overestimated when compared to the residual sink \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) from the Global Carbon Budget. When choosing \\(\\tau = 9 \\; \\mathrm{yr}\\), a better fit between the 1-box model-derived land sink and the observed land sink emerges. This could indicate that CO2-fertilization drives additional C storage that is more short lived than on average in vegetation and soil biomass. It probably also indicates that not all of the C assimilated by photosynthesis stays in the system for more than a few minutes to weeks. A substantial fraction of that C is respired by plants (autotrophic respiration, see also Chapter 4) before it is synthesized into longer-lived plant tissue biomass. The resulting evolution(s) of the land C cycle are illustrated in Figure 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Evolution of the land C cycle in response to alternative (schematic) trajectories of future CO2. The green line in panels of the bottom row indicates the observed land sink, derived as the residual of the Global Carbon Budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nExpress \\(I\\) as a function of \\(c_a\\), using the definition of \\(\\beta\\) from Equation 3.9, and using \\(c_{a,0}\\) and \\(I_0\\).\nCalculate \\(I(c_a)\\) for \\(c_a = 400\\) ppm and \\(I_0\\) as the pre-industrial value of total terrestrial gross photosynthesis from Figure 3.1 and using the value of \\(\\beta\\) (mean) from T. F. Keenan et al. (2023).\nIt is important to note that the land C sink trajectories are strongly dependent on whether the dominating process driving it is CO2 fertilization or forest recovery from past disturbance (or other drivers). The temporal course of ecosystem C pools after a disturbance is schematically illustrated in Figure 3.7. Sketch the resulting land C sink for the different CO2 trajectories of Figure 3.6 if the sink was exclusively driven by forest recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Schematic illustration of the recovery of the ecosystem C pool (relative magnitude) after a disturbance in time step 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhlström, Anders, Michael R.

    "text": "4.1 Light use efficiency model\nMonteith (1972) made the observation that the biomass productivity of a given (well-watered) crop (in the tropics) scales linearly with the amount of absorbed solar radiation, integrated over weeks to months. This observation underlies the general light use efficiency (LUE) model which describes ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis (referred to as gross primary production, GPP) as the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and the efficiency at which photons are used for assimilating C (LUE). \\[\n\\mathrm{GPP} = \\mathrm{PPFD} \\cdot \\mathrm{fAPAR} \\cdot \\mathrm{LUE}\n\\tag{4.1}\\] PPFD is the same as the also commonly used photosynthetically active (solar) radiation (PAR), but is expressed in moles of photons instead of energy units.\nOf course, a relationship with biomass productivity, as observed by Monteith (1972) should not be equated with a relationship with GPP. However, again, over longer periods of time, a given plant converts assimilated carbon into biomass at a relatively constant rate (see Chapter 5). Therefore, the observation by Monteith (1972) is instructive for our understanding. Indeed, models of terrestrial GPP are often formulated in the form of Equation 4.1 and are useful for estimating how GPP values over space and time (at the scale of weeks to months). The aspect that the observations by Monteith (1972) were made under well-watered conditions is a further caveat. However, it shall serve us in this chapter as we are - for now - ignoring the effects by limited root-zone water availability. We will relieve this simplification in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.\nThe linear dependence of GPP on PPFD implies that the variations of solar radiation over the seasons and across latitude directly translate to how GPP varies across these scales. This will be further described in Chapter 6. Note that at shorter time scales, GPP is no longer linearly related to PAR.\nIn the following, we delve deeper into each of the three factors of Equation 4.1. Brace yourself. This will take us from the Earth’s orbit in space to the scale of a cell where photosynthetic CO2 assimilation happens.",

    "section": "4.2 Solar radiation",
    "text": "4.2 Solar radiation\nThrough its influence on GPP, as described by Equation 4.1, solar radiation is the “engine” of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems. Temporal and spatial patterns of GPP are strongly driven by patterns in solar radiation. In this subsection, the processes are introduced which are responsible for these patterns.\nPPFD is a fraction of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (\\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\)). This fraction depends on the planetary albedo for visible light (\\(\\alpha_v\\), unitless), an atmospheric attenuation factor (\\(\\tau\\), unitless) that accounts for the elevation (\\(z\\))-dependent path length of a light ray travelling through the atmosphere and a factor that accounts for cloud cover \\(f_c\\). A further reduction by about 50% arises because photosynthesis uses only a range of the spectrum of wavelengths of solar radiation, corresponding to the visible light spectrum. The factor \\(f_{p}\\) accounts for this and for the conversion of \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\), expressed as an energy flux in W m-2, to a flux of photons in mol s-1 m-2. \\[\n\\mathrm{PPFD} = (1-\\alpha_{v})\\; \\tau(z, f_c) \\; f_{p}  \\; I_\\mathrm{TOA}\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nSolar radiation across the full short-wave spectrum emitted by the sun and incident at the land surface (top-of-canopy, \\(I_\\mathrm{0}\\)) is similarly related to \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). A different albedo applies for total short-wave radiation vs. the radiation in the photosynthetically active (and visible) spectrum. \\(I_\\mathrm{0}\\) is commonly expressed in energy units (W m-2). \\[\nI_\\mathrm{0} = (1-\\alpha_\\mathrm{sw})\\; \\tau(z, f_c) \\; I_\\mathrm{TOA}\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Map of solar radiation incident at the Earth surface, averaged over 1981-2010, based on Brun et al. (2022). Figure from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#/media/File:RSDS_wiki.png.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Solar geometry\nLet’s first step outside the atmosphere and focus on the solar geometry to understand \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). Solar geometry describes the cyclical movement of the Earth around the sun and how the resulting cyclically varying amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth. The top-of-the atmosphere perspective is relevant to separate atmospheric effects from planetary effects.\n\\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) scales in proportion with the solar constant \\(I_S\\) (1360.8 W m-2) and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the sun (\\(r_E\\)). \\[\nI_\\mathrm{TOA} = I_S r_E^{-2} \\cos \\theta_z\n\\tag{4.4}\\] \\(\\theta_z\\) is the solar zenith angle. The term \\(\\cos \\theta_z\\) accounts for the dependence of the solar radiation on the angle at which the sun’s rays reach the Earth surface (no terrain considered). It varies cyclically over the course of a day (with hour-of-day) and over the course of a year (with day-of-year). The zenith angle is zero when the sun is directly above the observer - in the zenith (Figure 4.2). At this point, the intensity of the solar radiation is at its maximum.\nNote that \\(r_E\\) is not constant over the course of a year as the Earth rotates around the sun not following a perfect circle but an ellipse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependence of the solar zenith angle on the hour-of-day, day-of-year, and the latitude is described by \\[\n\\cos \\theta_z = \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta +\\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\n\n\\(\\varphi\\) is the local latitude in radians (0 at the equator, \\(\\pi/2\\) at the poles)\n\\(\\delta\\) is the solar declination angle. It accounts for the tilt of the Earth relative to the plane in which it moves around the sun. It varies with the day-of-year (\\(23.5^\\circ \\pi/180\\) on the northern-hemispheric summer solstice, June 21, and \\(-23.5^\\circ \\pi/180\\) on the northern-hemispheric winter solstice, December 21)\n\\(h\\) is the solar hour angle. It varies with the hour-of-day (0 at solar noon, \\(\\pi\\) at “solar midnight”, \\(\\pi/12\\) at 1 hour after solar noon).\n\nA derivation of Equation 4.5 is given on Wikipedia.\n\n\n4.2.2 Sloped surfaces\nComing soon.\n\n\n4.2.3 Variations in solar radiation\nVariations in the solar zenith angle, as expressed through Equation 4.5, are shown for different latitudes and a mid-summer diurnal cycle in Figure 4.3.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\ncalc_cos_zenith_angle &lt;- function(\n    lat, # latitude in degrees\n    doy, # day of year (1-365)\n    hod  # hour of day (0-24, 12 is solar noon)\n){\n  doy_summer_solstice &lt;- 173 # day-of-year of summer solstice (21 Jun)\n  decl &lt;- 23.5 * cos((doy - doy_summer_solstice) / 365 * 2 * pi) * pi/180\n  phi &lt;- lat * pi / 180 # latitude in radians\n  hour_angle &lt;- (hod - 12) / 24 * 2 * pi\n  cos_zenith_angle &lt;- sin(phi) * sin(decl) + cos(phi) * cos(decl) * cos(hour_angle)\n  \n  # limit to zero - sun disappears behind the horizon\n  cos_zenith_angle &lt;- ifelse(cos_zenith_angle &lt; 0, 0, cos_zenith_angle)\n  return(cos_zenith_angle)\n}\n\n# Solar azimuth -------\n# at NH summer solstice (doy = 173)\nggplot() +\n  # at equator\n  geom_function(\n    aes(color = \"Equator\"),\n    fun = calc_cos_zenith_angle, \n    args = list(\n      lat = 0,\n      doy = 173\n    )) +\n  # at tropic (lat = 23.5)\n  geom_function(\n    aes(color = \"23.5° N\"),\n    fun = calc_cos_zenith_angle, \n    args = list(\n      lat = 23.5,\n      doy = 173\n    )) +\n  # at polar (lat = 66.5)\n  geom_function(\n    aes(color = \"66.5° N\"),\n    fun = calc_cos_zenith_angle, \n    args = list(\n      lat = 66.5,\n      doy = 173\n    )) +\n  # at north pole\n  geom_function(\n    aes(color = \"North pole\"),\n    fun = calc_cos_zenith_angle, \n    args = list(\n      lat = 90,\n      doy = 173\n    )) +\n  xlim(0, 24) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 12, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(\n    breaks = c(\"Equator\", \"23.5° N\", \"66.5° N\", \"North pole\"),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Cosine of solar zenith angle\",\n       subtitle = \"Summer solstice (21 June)\",\n       x = \"Hour of day\",\n       y = \"\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Cosine of the solar zenith angle at the solar noon and at the northern hemispheric summer solstice for different latitudes.

The summer solstice (21 June) is indicated by the dotted line. Note that the curves are not perfectly symmetrical with respect to the summer solstice line. This is because the Earth moves around the sun on an ellipse and hence the distance between the Earth and the sun varies over the year. The distance is at its minimum near the southern-hemispheric summer solstice. Therefore, the mid-summer maximum solar radiation at the southern tropic (23.5° S) is slightly higher than the mid-summer maximum solar radiation at the northern tropic (23.5° N).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# all combinations of day-of-year and latitude\ndf &lt;- expand.grid(\n  doy = seq(1, 365, by = 2), \n  lat = seq(-90, 90, by = 2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(s_toa = calc_daily_solar(lat, doy)$ra_j.m2)\n\ndf |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = doy,\n             y = lat,\n             fill = s_toa)) +\n\n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Top-of-atmosphere solar radiation\",\n       subtitle = \"Daily total, year 2000\",\n       x = \"Day of year\",\n       y = \"Latitude (°N)\",\n       fill = expression(paste(\"J m\"^-2))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Daily total top-of-atmosphere solar radiation in J m-2 by latitude and day-of-year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diurnal (over the course of a day) and seasonal patterns in top-of-atmosphere solar radiation, following from solar geometry and expressed through Equation 4.5, have direct consequences for CO2 uptake patterns, as expressed through Equation 4.1, Equation 4.2, and Equation 4.4 and described further in Chapter 6.\nSome features are particularly noteworthy about the patterns in \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\):\n\nThe diurnal variation of the instantaneous flux is largest in the tropics.\nThe seasonal variation of the daily total flux is largest at the north pole.\nAt the summer solstice, the daily total solar radiation is largest at the north pole, …\n… but the daily maximum instantaneous and the daytime mean radiation flux are lower at the north pole than at the equator at the summer solstice.\n\nThe biology of plants is attuned to the solar radiation patterns across different latitudes. The photosynthetic apparatus is constructed to make best use of the light, even during the hours of peak light intensity at mid-day. The phenological phases of plant growth reflect the light distribution over the seasons - evergreen plants dominate in the moist tropics to make use of the light year-round, while deciduous leaf strategies and annual life history strategies dominate in the northern latitudes where the seasonal fluctuation of light is large.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 Long-term variations in solar radiation\nSolar irradiance\nThe solar constant \\(I_S\\) isn’t actually constant but varies on the order of 0.1% of the course of a solar cycle. One cycle is approximately 11 years. The cyclic behavior is related to the periodic flip of the sun’s magnetic field and the number of sunspots. The radiation emitted from the sun and the number of sunspots are at their minimum after a magnetic flip. There is also a small long-term trend in the solar radiation, having increased by &lt;0.1% since the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715). Solar irradiance is measured at high altitude to minimize the influence of the atmosphere (\\(\\tau\\) in Eq. Equation 4.2) and get information about how \\(I_S\\) varies. Reconstructions of solar irradiance changes for the pre-instrumental period are based on the relationship between \\(I_S\\) and the (easily observable) sunspot number. Variations in \\(I_S\\) are small and do not have a dominant effect on climate and the carbon cycle that would override other forcings, especially for the industrial period (IPCC 2021).\nVolcanic activity\nVolcanic eruptions can influence the solar radiation at the Earth surface. Events that reduce solar radiation by more than 1 W m-2 occur approximately every 35-40 years (Gulev et al. 2021) and affect climate and the carbon cycle for up to a few years after very large eruptions. The increased aerosol load in the atmosphere reduces the total radiative energy flux (reducing \\(\\tau\\) in Eq. Equation 4.2). However, through the strong positive effect of the aerosol load on the share of diffuse versus direct radiation, volcanic aerosols can affect the terrestrial carbon cycle, (somehow surprisingly) leading to a greater land C sink following years of large volcanic eruptions (Section 4.3).\nOrbital parameters\nThe largest changes in \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) arise over millennial time scales and are related to variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun. These Milankovic cycles are the trigger for the large climate swings between ice ages and warm periods over the course of ~100,000 years. Variations in the orbital parameters affect the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). Orbital parameters that vary periodically are:\n\nThe eccentricity of the Earth’s elliptical orbit which affects the distance between the Earth and the sun, affecting \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) via \\(r_E\\) in Equation 4.4. It varies with a period of approximately 100,000 years.\nThe obliquity - the tilt of the axis of the Earth’s own rotation relative to the plane in which the Earth rotates around the sun. A greater obliquity amplifies seasonal variations in \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). The obliquity is currently at 23.44°. At its minimum, it’s at 21.1°. Obliquity varies over 41,000 years.\nThe precession is the rotation of the Earth’s own rotation axis itself. The effect of precession, in combination with the fact that the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, is that the variation of the sun-Earth distance shifts over the seasons. It varies with a period of about 25,700 years.\n\nThe point of minimal distance coinciding with the summer solstice leads to the largest mid-summer radiation maximum. As a result, the incident solar radiation over the northern-hemispheric summer at 65°N varied by about 83 W m-2 during the past million years. These changes are much larger than the ones driven by solar irradiance and volcanic activity.\nAbout 6000 years ago, during the Mid-Holocene Warm Period, a summer maximum insolation for the northern hemisphere was reached (Figure 4.6). During this period, temperatures and solar irradiance during the growing season were elevated relative to the pre-industrial period and precipitation patterns shifted. This had profound effects on vegetation and the carbon cycle. Testimony to this change are reconstructions that document a “Green Sahara” and a northward shift temperate and boreal forest biomes (MacDonald et al. 2000; Prentice, Jolly, and Participants 2000) during this period.\n\n\nCode\n# test:\n# tmp &lt;- purrr::map(seq(from = -300000, to = 2000, by = 500),\n#                   ~calc_daily_solar(65, 173, year = .)) |&gt; \n#   purrr::map_dbl(\"ra_j.m2\")\n\n# all combinations of day-of-year and latitude\ndf_holo &lt;- expand.grid(\n  doy = seq(1, 365, by = 2), \n  lat = seq(-90, 90, by = 2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(s_toa_holo = calc_daily_solar(lat, doy, year = -4000)$ra_j.m2) |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    df,\n    by = c(\"doy\", \"lat\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(diff = (s_toa_holo - s_toa))\n\ndf_holo |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = doy,\n             y = lat,\n             fill = diff)) +\n  geom_raster() +\n  khroma::scale_fill_roma(reverse = TRUE) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 173, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Mid-Holocene top-of-atmosphere solar radiation anomaly\",\n       subtitle = expression(paste(\"Daily total, \", italic(I)[TOA], \"(6 kyr BP) - \", italic(I)[TOA], \"(present)\" )),\n       x = \"Day of year\",\n       y = \"Latitude (°N)\",\n       fill = expression(paste(\"J m\"^-2))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Mid-Holocene solar radiation anomaly, calculated as the difference in the daily total top-of-atmosphere solar radiation at 6 kyr BP minus present-day (year 2000).",

    "text": "4.3 Canopy light absorption\nPhotosynthetic CO2 uptake only operates if active (green) leaves are out. The relationship between the amount of leaves and GPP are introduced here. Active leaf area varies across the seasons and space in response to the seasonality of temperature and light and water availability. The seasonal fluctuation of leaf area, most visible for deciduous trees, is referred to as (leaf) phenology. The drivers of temporal and spatial variations of phenology and leaf area are introduced later.\nThe fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) increases with the projected (one-sided) surface area of leaves per unit ground area (the leaf area index, LAI). Note that the total surface area of leaves is roughly twice the projected surface area. The LAI is an ecosystem-level variable and reflects the leaf area density of the whole canopy which may be composed of multiple species and organised in multiple canopy layers (Figure 4.7). While temperate and boreal forests may form a single understorey and attain LAI values of 4-6 m2 m-1, tropical moist forests may have multiple canopy layers and an LAI of over 6 m2 m-1 (Figure 2.15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Vertical profile of the leaf area index (LAI) and light absorption the canopy for a typical oak forest, where most leaves are located in a dense canopy without an understorey. Figure from Bonan (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the intensity of shortwave (solar) radiation is highest at the top of the canopy, it is progressively attenuated as it penetrates into the canopy. Radiation gets reflected, absorbed and transmitted by individual leaves. Each of these processes affects light differently in different wavelengths, depends on the solar zenith angle, on the three-dimensional arrangement of leaves in the canopy (angles, “clumping”), and on the pigments on the leaf surfaces that are responsible for light absorption. Pigments change across species and may vary in response to stress (e.g., by frost, heat, or water limitation).\nIn brief, canopy radiative transfer is complex. A simple model of radiation extinction is given by the Beer-Lambert law. To apply it for radiative transfer in the canopy, we assume that a leaf only absorbs light, but does not reflect or transmit it. Following this model, the light extinction at canopy depth \\(z\\) (measuring from the top) is proportional to the light intensity at that depth and an “optical density” \\(\\mu\\). \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\mu\\;I(z)\n\\] We further assume that the canopy is a homogenous turbid medium. In other words, we assume that leaves are uniformly distributed across the canopy and that the optical density is given by the leaf area index \\(L\\) divided by the total canopy depth \\(z_0\\): \\[\n\\mu = k \\frac{L}{z_0}\n\\] \\(k\\) is the leaf area-specific optical density, or light extinction coefficient. Therefore, the radiation intensity at the bottom of the canopy (\\(z_0\\)) is: \\[\nI(z_0) = I_0 \\; e^{-kL}\\;,\n\\] and the fraction of absorbed (photosynthetically active) radiation is \\[\n\\mathrm{fAPAR} = 1 - e^{-kL}\\;.\n\\] A typical value of the light extinction coefficient \\(k\\) in the visible (photosynthetically active) wavelength spectrum is 0.5.\nThe radiation \\(I\\) consists of direct radiation from the sun and diffuse radiation from the sky and from radiation scattered within the canopy. This distinction is relevant for understanding radiation absorption by the canopy and canopy-level photosynthesis. Two important implications are the following. First, diffuse radiation is more effectively absorbed by canopies, particularly at low LAI. The reduction of GPP under cloudy conditions is therefore less than what would be expected from considering only changes in \\(I_0\\) (the effective \\(k\\) is higher for diffuse radiation than for direct radiation).\nSecond, the energy flux of direct radiation is much higher than that of diffuse radiation. Although at greater canopy depths, leaves are more frequently exposed to diffuse than to direct radiation, the latter provides potentially valuable energy for photosynthesis, but occurs very rarely (sunflecks). Leaves have to balance the rare high-intensity light levels and the frequent low-intensity levels for adjusting photosynthetic capacities.",

    "text": "4.4 Photosynthesis\nThe efficiency at which absorbed photons (radiation) are converted into C in the form of sugars depends on the conductance to CO2 uptake by the leaf and on the activity of the photosynthetic machinery. In this subsection, we dive very deep into the term LUE in Equation 4.1.\nCO2 uptake by the leaf happens by diffusion through pores at the leaf surface (stomata, Figure 4.8). The opening of stomata is dynamically regulated in response to environmental conditions (light, CO2, temperature, atmospheric humidity) and controls the conductance to CO2 diffusion. The CO2 uptake flux by diffusive transport through stomata can thus be described by Fick’s law which states that the flux is proportional to the concentration difference of CO2 inside and outside the leaf. \\[\nA = g_s(c_a - c_i)\n\\tag{4.6}\\] \\(c_a\\) is the ambient CO2 concentration (outside the leaf), and \\(c_i\\) is the CO2 concentration at the chloroplast. \\(g_s\\) is the stomatal conductance. Note that we use the variable name \\(A\\) here for CO2 assimilation by photosynthesis. In constrast to the ecosystem-level variable GPP, \\(A\\) refers to the leaf-level flux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: CO2 diffuses into the leaf through stomata, while water vapour diffuses out of the leaf. The water vapour diffusion out of the leaves (transpiration) is introduced in Chapter 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotosynthetic CO2 assimilation leads to a continous depletion of CO2 inside the leaf. Therefore, \\(c_i\\) reflects photosynthetic rates. This description of \\(A\\) is specific for plants that follow the C3 photosynthetic pathway - the majority of plants and all trees. Grasses growing in warm climates predominantly follow the C4 photosynthetic pathway (see Section 4.4.8).\nModelling photosynthesis is relatively complex because \\(g_s\\) depends on \\(A\\). Equation 4.6 can therefore not be solved in a straight-forward manner. Furthermore, plants coordinate stomatal conductance to balance water losses and C assimilation but the exact relationship varies between species and depends on a multitude of mechanisms and traits related water transport in the plant (Section 4.5). Here, let’s start by taking \\(g_s\\) as given and look at how the assimilation rate \\(A\\) depends on \\(c_i\\).\nThe primary processes are happening in the chloroplasts which are located in the mesophyll cells of leaves. After diffusing across stomata, CO2 diffuses across the mesophyll cell to the chloroplast. The conductance to this diffusion step - mesophyll conductance - is often ignored for modelling photosynthesis. Reflecting this, we are referring to “leaf-internal CO2 concentration, \\(c_i\\)” here, instead of a more correct CO2 concentration at the chloroplast.\nBefore returning to a mathematical description of photosynthesis, let’s step back and look at the process of leaf-level photosyntheis. Three steps of the photosynthetic apparatus can be distinguished (based on Lambers, Chapin, and Pons (2008) and Bonan (2015)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Overview of photosynthesis, distinguishing the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Image taken https://bookdown.org/jcog196013/BS2003/photosynthesis.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.1 Light absorption at the cellular level\nLight (photons) in the photosynthetically active wavelength spectrum (400-700 nm) is absorbed by pigments - mainly chlorophyll. The absorbed energy is transported in the form of excited chlorophyll to the reaction centers of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Relevant for photosynthesis is the number of photons in the photosynthetically active spectrum, not their total energy. That’s why Equation 4.2 is expressed in units of photons, not energy (Watts). A photon in the blue wavelength has the same effect on CO2 assimilation as a photon in the red wavelength. The excess energy is dissipated as heat or through other pathways.\n\n\n4.4.2 Light reactions\nIn the reaction centers, the excitation energy is used for splitting electrons from water molecules, producing oxygen (O2) as a “side-product”. The electrons are transported along the electron transport chain and are used to produce NADPH and ATP. These are called the light reactions of photosynthesis. Up to here, radiation energy has been converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP. The production of ATP consumes inorganic phosphate.\n\n\n4.4.3 Calvin cycle\nNADPH and ATP are then used for reducing CO2 (the energy-demanding reversal of oxidation) in the Calvin cycle. This step forms C3 compounds (triose-phosphates) and occurs independently of light. It is therefore commonly referred to as the “dark reactions” of photosynthesis. Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the principal enzyme involved in the Calvin cycle and the amount of Rubisco determines the capacity for the carboxylation of RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate). Rubisco also catalyzes the oxygenation of RuBP which consumes O2 and produces CO2 as part of photorespiration. This respiration scales with photosynthetic activity and reduces the net photosynthetic CO2 by 30-50%, depending on the relative concentrations of CO2 and O2. At very low CO2 levels, around 30-50 ppm, the photorespiratory compensation point is reached and net photosynthesis is zero. In contrast to photorespiration, dark respiration (\\(R_d\\)), which also produces CO2, arises from the decarboxylation of Rubisco and is independent of light, but proportional to the amount of Rubisco.\nReduced C in the form of sucrose or (after an additional step) starch is either consumed in the leaf during the night, or exported through the phloem and used for synthesising biomass or supplying plant-internal C storage as non-structural C.\n\n\n4.4.4 Summary\nThe chemical summary equation of photosynthesis is: \\[\nn\\mathrm{CO}_2 + 2n\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{O})_n + n\\mathrm{O}_2 + n\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}\n\\tag{4.7}\\] A total of eight photons is consumed to assimilate one molecule of CO2. For each molecule of CO2, one molecule of O2 is produced. And for each molecule of CO2, one molecule of H2O is consumed (net). Note however, that this water consumption is not the primary reason for why plants use water. A much larger amount of water is consumed by the diffusion of water vapour from the water-saturated air inside the leaves out of the stomata. This transpiration flux is further explained in Chapter 8.\n\n\n4.4.5 Response to light and CO2\nThe three steps described above operate in series and each step is potentially rate-limiting and responds differently to the environment. The rates are coordinated such that they are roughly co-limiting for average environmental conditions to which a leaf is exposed during a day. An imbalance of rates can lead to an excess production of electrons and can cause damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. This happens for example when leaves are exposed to very cold temperatures and high light during a frost event, or when you move your indoor plant that has been sitting in a dark corner for years suddenly into full sunlight outdoors.\nThe response of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (\\(A\\)) to light (PPFD) and leaf-internal CO2 (\\(c_i\\)) reflects the serial nature of how the light and dark reactions are connected. \\(A\\) saturates both in response to increasing PPFD as well as to increasing \\(c_i\\). When a leaf is exposed to increasing PPFD, \\(A\\) initially increases and eventually saturates (Figure 4.10). The slope of the initial linear increase reflects the efficiency at which photons are used for CO2 assimilation (the quantum yield \\(\\varphi_0\\)). Under these conditions, light, i.e. the rate of the light reactions, are limiting, not CO2. Under conditions of very high light, the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle become limiting. The assimilation rate attained under saturating light is commonly referred to as \\(A_\\mathrm{sat}\\).\nThe level at which the light response of \\(A\\) saturates varies within a species and across different species. Variations within species arise through the acclimation of the light reaction capacities to the typical light intensities to which a leaf is exposed. Acclimation evolves over time scales of weeks to months (Thus, your indoor plant suffers because the change to high-light conditions happened to fast.). \\(A_\\mathrm{sat}\\) also varies across species, reflecting the adaptation through evolution of different species to the environment in which they commonly grow. Typical difference in light adaptation are evident between plants that grow in the shady understorey versus plants that grow in the sun-exposed upper canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Response of leaf photosynthesis to light and how it varies within species through acclimation to different growth environments (A) and across species through evolutionary adaptation (B). Figure from Lambers, Chapin, and Pons (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, the response of \\(A\\) to \\(c_i\\) initially increase and saturates at high \\(c_i\\). This is reflected by the so-called “A-ci curve”. Commonly, net assimilation \\(A_n=A-R_d\\) is considered. \\(A_n\\) is initially negative until the photorespiratory compensation point (\\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\)) is reached. Then, \\(A_n\\) increases steeply with \\(c_i\\) as it is limited by the rate of RuBP carboxylation by Rubisco (\\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\)). This functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted \\(A_C\\). As \\(c_i\\) increases further, \\(A\\) is no longer limited by RuBP carboxylation, but by the rate at which RuBP becomes available. This, in turn, is governed by the rate at which ATP and NADPH are produced and thus by the rate of electron transport \\(J\\). This functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted \\(A_J\\). A limiting electron transport rate may be due to limiting light or a limiting capacity of electron transport (\\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\)). A slower further increase of \\(A\\) with \\(c_i\\) in the electron transport-limited range is due to the suppression of RuBP oxygenation at high concentrations of CO2 (relative to O2). The effective assimilation rate across the full range of \\(c_i\\) is the minimum of the electron transport-limited and the RuBP carboxylation-limited rate: \\[\nA_n = \\min(A_C, A_J) - R_d\n\\]\nThe A-ci curve (Figure 4.11) can be measured in the field and reveals multiple quantities (\\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\), \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\), \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\), and the “shape parameters” of \\(A_C\\) and \\(A_J\\)). These quantities are key for quantitatively describing and modeling leaf photosynthesis. The acclimation and adaptation of \\(A_\\mathrm{max}\\) (Figure 4.10) reflects an acclimation and adaptation of the electron transport capacity and the capacity for RuBP carboxylation. Although acclimation can occur, it is not fast enough to respond to the strongly varying light conditions during a day. Therefore, plants have to tune the capacities of the different photosynthetic reactions such that they are mostly near the co-limitation point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: The A-ci curve. Net assimilation (An = A - Rd) is measured for different levels of leaf-internal CO2 concentrations (black dots). The functional forms of AC and AJ are fitted to the data points. The grey point indicates the co-limitation point. Figure from Duursma (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.6 Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model\nFollowing the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (FvCB) model for C3 photosynthesis (Farquhar, Caemmerer, and Berry 1980), the RuBP carboxylation-limited assimilation rate \\(A_C\\) can be described as \\[\nA_C = V_\\mathrm{cmax} \\frac{c_i - \\Gamma^\\ast}{c_i + K} \\;,\n\\tag{4.8}\\] where \\(K\\) is the effective Michaelis-Menten coefficient for \\(A_C\\), considering the balance of carboxylation and oxygenation by Rubisco. It depends on the partial pressure of oxygen (\\(p\\mathrm{O}_2\\)). \\[\nK = K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{p\\mathrm{O}_2}{K_o} \\right)\n\\] \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\), \\(K_c\\), \\(K_o\\), and \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\) all have a temperature dependency. In addition, \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\) is proportional to atmospheric pressure. These dependencies are shown in Section 4.4.7 and are described in full detail in Stocker et al. (2020).\nThe electron transport-limited assimilation rate \\(A_J\\) can be described as \\[\nA_J = \\frac{J}{4} \\cdot \\frac{c_i - \\Gamma^\\ast}{c_i + 2 \\Gamma^\\ast}\\;.\n\\tag{4.9}\\] The electron transport rate \\(J\\) is described by a saturating function that increases with absorbed light \\(I_\\mathrm{abs}\\) up to a maximum rate \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\) \\[\nJ = \\frac{4\\varphi_0 I_\\mathrm{abs}}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{4\\varphi_0 I_\\mathrm{abs}}{J_\\mathrm{max}}\\right)^2}}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nTogether, Equation 4.8 and Equation 4.9 describe the combined effect of \\(c_i\\), (leaf) temperature, the absorbed photon flux density, and atmospheric pressure on leaf-level CO2 assimilation. A-ci and the A vs. PPFD curves, as shown for measurements in Figure 4.10 and Figure 4.11, can thereby be modeled.\nHowever, the FvCB model, on its own, does not allow us to model the LUE term in Equation 4.1. An important additional ingredient is the stomatal conductance (\\(g_s\\)) which is relevant for determining the ratio of ambient to leaf-internal CO2 concentrations. It is described in Section 4.5.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rpmodel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# modified seq() function to get a logarithmically spaced sequence\nlseq &lt;- function(from=1, to=100000, length.out=6) {\n  exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length.out = length.out))\n}\n\n# Set model parameters (constants)\n# see Stocker et al., 2020 GMD for a description\nbeta &lt;- 146          # unit cost ratio a/b\nc_cost &lt;- 0.41       # marginal cost of Jmax\ngamma &lt;- 0.105       # unit cost ratio c/b\nkphio &lt;- 0.085       # quantum yield efficiency\nc_molmass &lt;- 12.0107 # molar mass, g / mol\n\n# Define environmental conditions\ntc &lt;- 15             # temperature, deg C\nppfd &lt;- 500          # micro-mol/m2/s\nvpd  &lt;- 300          # Pa\nco2  &lt;- 400          # ppm\nelv  &lt;- 0            # m.a.s.l.\nfapar &lt;- 1           # fraction\npatm &lt;- 101325       # Pa\n\n# get photosynthesis parameters gammastar, vcmax, jmax from p-model\n# this assumes vcmax and jmax to be optimally acclimated/adapted to\n# the specified environmental conditions and considers the temperature\n# and atmospheric-pressure dependence of all parameters.\nout_pmodel &lt;- rpmodel(\n  tc             = tc,\n  vpd            = vpd,\n  co2            = co2,\n  elv            = elv,\n  kphio          = kphio,\n  beta           = beta,\n  fapar          = fapar,\n  ppfd           = ppfd,\n  method_optci   = \"prentice14\",\n  method_jmaxlim = \"wang17\",\n  do_ftemp_kphio = FALSE\n  )\n\n# electron transport-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_aj &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kphio, ppfd, jmax){\n  kphio * ppfd * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + 2 * gammastar) * 1/sqrt(1+((4 * kphio * ppfd)/jmax)^2)\n}\n\n# RuBP carboxylation-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_ac &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kmm, vcmax){\n  vcmax * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + kmm)\n}\n\n# assimilation rate given stomatal conductance and leaf-internal \n# CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_a_gs &lt;- function(ci, gs, ca){\n  gs * (ca - ci)\n}\n\n# conversion of CO2 concentration in ppm to partial pressure in Pa\nco2_to_ca &lt;- function( co2, patm ){\n  ( 1.0e-6 ) * co2 * patm\n}\n\ndf_ci &lt;- tibble(\n  ci = seq(0, 1000, length.out = 100)) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(ci_pa = co2_to_ca(ci, patm = patm)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_j = calc_aj(ci_pa, \n                       out_pmodel$gammastar, \n                       kphio = kphio, \n                       ppfd = ppfd, \n                       jmax = out_pmodel$jmax)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_c = calc_ac(ci_pa, \n                       out_pmodel$gammastar, \n                       out_pmodel$kmm, \n                       vcmax = out_pmodel$vcmax)) |&gt;\n  mutate(a_act = min(a_j, a_c)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_gs = calc_a_gs(ci_pa, \n                          gs = out_pmodel$gs, \n                          ca = out_pmodel$ca))\n  \ndf_ci |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(a_j, a_c, a_gs), \n               names_to = \"Rate\", \n               values_to = \"a_\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = ci)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = a_, color = Rate)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = a_act)) +\n  xlim(00, 1000) + \n  ylim(-20, 80) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(italic(\"c\")[i], \" (ppm)\")), \n       y = expression(paste(italic(\"A\"), \" (\", mu, \"mol m\" ^{-2},\" s\" ^{-1}, \")\"))) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"\",\n    breaks = c(\"a_gs\",\n               \"a_j\",\n               \"a_c\"\n               ),\n    labels = c(expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[gs])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[J])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[C]))),\n    values = c( \"#009E73\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#E69F00\")) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: The A-ci curve as simulated by the FvCB model.

This acclimation affects the temperature response. Therefore, the functional relationships shown here are relevant for understanding how CO2 uptake varies in response to temperature over the course of a day. However, over longer time scales, plants acclimate to their growth environment such that the temperature optimum of photosynthesis (the peak of the \\(A_n\\)-temperature curve) shifts as a function of the growth temperature - an average temperature to which the leaf is exposed (Kumarathunge et al. 2019).\n\n\n4.4.8 C4 photosynthesis\nComing soon.",

    "text": "4.5 Transpiration\nThe opening of stomata is highly sensitive to environmental factors and the CO2 assimilation rate feeds back to stomatal opening. By opening and closing stomata, plants regulate the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the ambient air into the leaves and to the photosynthesis reaction sites. Simultaneously, when stomata are open, water vapour diffuses out of the leaf - transpiration. This link between CO2 and water loss is at the core of stomatal regulation to balance C uptake and desiccation.\nThe diffusive supply of CO2 to the photosynthetic reaction sites is determined by a series of conductances. The description of the diffusive CO2 uptake in Equation 4.6 resolves this as a single conductance. However, stomatal conductance is only one chain in this series. More realistically, the leaf boundary layer conductance and the mesophyll conductance are treated separately from the stomatal conductance. However, because the leaf boundary layer conductance is much larger than the stomatal conductance, it is not limiting. Furthermore, actively regulated plant physiological responses to the environment arise through the stomatal conductance \\(g_s\\). As described in Section 4.4, mesophyll conductance is often ignored due to practical limitations for separating it from stomatal conductance in measurements and due to very poorly known dependencies to the environment. Hence, we focus on \\(g_s\\) here and describe the diffusive CO2 supply to photosynthesis by Equation 4.6.\nThe diffusive water vapour flux out of the leaf - transpiration - is driven by the difference of water vapour pressure in the leaf-interior air spaces (\\(e_i\\)) and the the water vapour pressure at the leaf surface (\\(e_s\\)). Their difference is commonly referred to as the vapour pressure deficit (VPD), here denoted as \\(D = e_s - e_i\\). Leaf-interior air spaces are water vapour-saturated, while the surrounding air is not. Fick’s law predicts that a diffusive flux occurs in presence of a concentration difference, hence transpiration can be described as \\[\nE = 1.6 \\; g_s \\; D\n\\tag{4.11}\\] The factor 1.6 arises due to the lower diffusivity of CO2 compared with H2O. Hence, \\(g_s\\) has to be understood as a conductance to CO2 diffusion (mol CO2 m-2 s-1).\nWater loss through transpiration poses risks and incurs costs for a plant. The diffusive water vapour flux through stomata has to be maintained by root water uptake from the soil and transport along the xylem in the plant. When the water content in the rooting zone declines, it becomes increasingly hard for plants to extract water from the soil - they have to “suck” out the water with a increasingly negative water potential - a negative pressure. The hydraulic relationships of water transport along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum will be introduced later. What matters here is that such negative water potentials along the water transport pathway are dangerous for the plant and can lead to lethal desiccation of cells, leaves, branches, or entire plants.\nAvoidance of dangerous desiccation is enabled by responses at the level of leaves and the plant which operate at a range of time scales. At time scales of seconds to minutes and at the level of a leaf, stomatal conductance is reduced in response to dry air and dry soil conditions. At time scales of weeks to months, or even years, the the leaf area of a plant may decline under dry conditions. At even longer time scales (albeit this time scale is subject to large unknowns and active research), plants are genetically adapted (or may acclimate within their lifetime) to dry conditions by resistant water transport (resistant xylem) and effective water uptake organs (deeper roots).\nObviously, such adaptations and the largely instantaneous stomatal response incurs a cost - the opportunity cost of reduced CO2 assimilation when stomatal conductance is reduced and the construction cost of building water-stress adapted organs. Hence, plants always have to balance carbon uptake and water loss and a tight carbon-water coupling at the level of plants, and ecosystems arises from these leaf-level processes.\n\n4.5.1 Water use efficiency\nThe trade-off between transpiration and assimilation can be measured by considering their ratio by combining Equation 4.6 and Equation 4.11 to define the instantaneous water-use efficiency: \\[\n\\frac{A_n}{E} = \\frac{c_a(1 - \\chi)}{1.6\\;D}\\;,\n\\tag{4.12}\\] where \\(\\chi = c_i/c_a\\). The instantaneous water-use efficiency is proportional to \\(D^{-1}\\). In other words, the drier the air, the more transpiration per unit net CO2 assimilation a leaf “suffers”. This demonstrates the strong effect of atmospheric dryness on the water-carbon trade-off. To remove the effect of vapour pressure deficit (\\(D\\)) on transpiration and focus on the biological component of the water-carbon trade-off, the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) is defined by relating net assimilation to stomatal conductance: \\[\n\\frac{A_n}{g_s} = \\frac{c_a}{1.6}(1 - \\chi)\n\\tag{4.13}\\] Note that Equation 4.12 and Equation 4.13 are written as being proportional to \\(c_a(1-\\chi)\\). Of course, this term is mathematically equivalent to \\((c_a - c_i)\\). However, there is a reason for expressing it this way. First, it reflects the direct influence of \\(c_a\\) ambient (atmospheric) CO2 concentration on the water-carbon trade-off - less water is lost for a given amount of C assimilation under elevated CO2. Second, observations suggest that \\(\\chi\\) is regulated by plants to remain relatively constant under a wide range of CO2 levels (Ainsworth and Long 2005) and Figure 4.14. The near constancy of \\(\\chi\\) is also reflected by the observation that \\(A_n\\) and \\(g_s\\) vary in near proportion across a wide range of light levels (Bonan 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: Constancy of leaf-internal to ambient CO2.
