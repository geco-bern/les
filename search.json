    "text": "1.1.1 Annual swings in atmospheric CO2\nThe longest-running record of direct measurements of atmospheric CO2 is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, atop a volcano on Hawaii. This record has become iconic for documenting the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 - a greenhouse gas - since the great economic acceleration after the Second World War. This has provided a basis for understanding the relationship between emissions of anthropogenic CO2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere and for estimating the climate impact of this important greenhouse gas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Atmospheric CO2 from Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. The red curve represents monthly mean values. The black curve represents the same after removing an average seasonal cycle. Source: Dr. Pieter Tans, NOAA/GML (gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) and Dr. Ralph Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe time series in Figure 1.1 shows not only the accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 over the past decades, but also its regular annual swings - the “breathing of the Earth”. This is the result of the seasonal cycles in CO2 uptake and release by terrestrial ecosystems. CO2 uptake peaks in early early summer in the northern extra-tropics - driven by the high light availability and high photosynthetic rates of young leaves in the early summer months. CO2 release by respiring plants and soil microbes has a shifted seasonality and tends to have a smaller amplitude, compared to CO2 uptake. The net of the two drives changes in atmospheric CO2 which are measured here in the free atmosphere - unaffected by local anthropogenic sources - atop a volcano on Hawaii.\nThe processes responsible for the breathing of the Earth will be introduced in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.\n\n\n1.1.2 Year-to-year changes of the global carbon budget\nAnthropogenic carbon emissions in the form of CO2, resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels and from land use change, are partly taken up by the ocean and partly by terrestrial ecosystems. The remainder remains in the atmosphere and drives the atmospheric CO2 growth (see Figure 1.1). Each of these components gets estimated and updated each year as the Global Carbon Budget. The latest scientific publication is Friedlingstein et al. (2023).\nEstimates of each component are largely independent and rely on different types of observations, data, and methods. Fossil emissions are based on energy statistics and cement production data, land use emissions are based on land-use and land-use change data and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based products. The land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models (Friedlingstein et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Annual carbon emissions (positive) and their redistribution between the ocean, land, and atmosphere (negative). The black line in the positive domain represents total emissions and is mirrored by the black line in the negative domain which represents the total of the land sink, ocean sink, and atmospheric growth. Design and data are based on the Global Carbon Budget. In contrast to Friedlingstein et al. (2023), the land sink is defined here as the carbon budget residual (introduced in Chapter 3). The budget imbalance term - the difference between Sland calculated as the budget residual vs. bottom-up using land C cycle models - is shown by the separate fine grey line.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 shows that the largest year-to-year variations in the redistribution of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is in the land sink component. While variations in the ocean sink and in emissions are relatively small, the carbon balance of the terrestrial biosphere varies strongly between years. This leads to substantial variations in annual atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Annual variations in the land C balance have been found to originate mostly from semi-arid regions, where large year-to-year variations in precipitation, often linked to El-Nino-Southern-Oscillation climate variability, alter water limitation of vegetation and drought-related disturbances, including fire activity (Ahlström et al. 2015; Humphrey et al. 2018). This leads to large year-to-year variability in CO2 uptake and release by land ecosystems and leaves an imprint on the rise in atmospheric CO2. This also demonstrates the sensitivity of terrestrial C storage to climatic variations and that the response of the land biosphere to climate extremes can drastically alter the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere and thus the rate of climate change.\nThe global carbon budget will be introduced in Chapter 5.\n\n\n1.1.3 Responses to rapid climate change in the past\nThe climate of the past 11,000 years (11 ka) until the Industrial Revolution was relatively stable, at least in comparison to the climate of the Last Glacial period. This period was marked by millennial-scale climate oscillations where temperatures rose by up to 16\\(^\\circ\\)C within a few decades (Oeschger et al. 1984; Dansgaard et al. 1993). When first discovered in measurments of an ice core recovered from Greenland, the massive excursions of the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal - a proxy for air temperature - were considered a measurement error. But the correspondence of similar excursions measured on a different Greenland ice core and the coincidence of the most recent such excursion with a similar pattern found in the \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal of carbonate in the lake sediment of Gerzensee (near Bern) (Oeschger et al. 1984) confirmed the robustness of these rapid climate change events in the past. Reflecting this, these rapid climate swings between about 80 and 10 ka BP were named Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Today, Dansgaard-Oeschger events are undersood to be oscillations of the Earth system that occurr without external triggers, but arise from the interaction of ocean and ice sheet dynamics, and are confined to Earth system states corresponding to the glacial periods of the late Pleistocene (Stocker and Johnsen 2003; Vettoretti et al. 2022).\nThe terrestrial biosphere was strongly affected by these large and rapid climate changes and left its imprints in several palaeo records (Figure 1.3). In response to the climate warming, atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations increased rapidly. Natural CH4 sources almost exclusively in land ecosystems (wetlands, fire). In parallel, the amount of dust transported to Greenland declined rapidly as climate warmed. This reflects an expansion of vegetation cover into dust-forming regions (e.g., deserts and peri-glacial areas). Also in parallel, nitrous oxide (N2O), another greenhouse gas, increased. This increase unfolded more gradually and reflects both oceanic and terrestrial sources. Furthermore, fire activity in the northern hemisphere, measured by charcoal deposits in Greenland ice cores, increased as the climate warmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Ice core and biomass burning records of Earth system changes during Dansgaard-Oeschger events - rapid climate change events during the last Glacial period, between 80 and 10 ka BP (kilo-years, 10\\(^{3}\\) years before present). Shading indicates significant patterns in the response of the time series to the events of abrupt warming and rapid cooling. (a) \\(\\delta^{18}\\)O signal is a proxy for air temperature. (b-f) Time series of reconstructed atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, dust and fire, temporally aligned and aggregated from subsets of the time series covering multiple Dansgaard-Oeschger events. BYRD: Byrd station, Antarctica; EDC: EPICA Dome C; NGRIP: North Greenland Ice Core Project. Figure from Arneth et al. (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variations in land-mediated greenhouse gases, dust, and fire are attest to the large and hemisphere-scale changes in terrestrial biosphere functioning in response to climate variations. Of course, greenhouse gases, dust, and fire-related emissions of CO2 and aerosols are radiative forcing agents themselves and thus affect the climate. These changes during Dansgaard-Oescher events therefore demonstrate the important role of the land biosphere in mediating Earth system changes.\nThe sources of multiple land-mediated greenhouse gases will be introduced in Chapter 10.\n\n\n1.1.4 Feedbacks\nLand ecosystems are a major sink for anthropogenic CO2. Between a quarter and a third of the C emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and by land use change is taken up again by land ecosystems (Chapter 3). This uptake flux partly buffers the anthropogenic disturbance of the Earth system. This is called a negative feedback (Chapter 13). Without it, the rise in atmospheric CO2 would be about 30-50% more rapid. The terrestrial carbon cycle is steered by a multitude of processes, operating at very different scales, and it is characterised by an enormous heterogeneity in space - across ecosystem types, climate and soil conditions. There is not just a single process responsible for this apparent negative global-scale climate-land biosphere feedback and the negative feedback is partly compensated by positive feedbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: An overview of physical and biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate system. (a) Synthesis of physical, biogeophysical and non-carbon dioxide (CO2) biogeochemical feedbacks that are included in the definition of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) assessed in this Technical Summary. These feedbacks have been assessed using multiple lines of evidence including observations, models and theory. The net feedback is the sum of the Planck response, water vapour and lapse rate, surface albedo, cloud, and biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. Bars denote the mean feedback values, and uncertainties representvery likely ranges; (b) Estimated values of individual biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. The atmospheric methane (CH4) lifetime and other non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks have been calculated using global Earth system model simulations from AerChemMIP, while the CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) source responses to climate have been assessed for the year 2100 using a range of modelling approaches using simplified radiative forcing equations. The estimates represent the mean and 5–95% range. The level of confidence in these estimates is lowowing to the large model spread. (c) Carbon-cycle feedbacks as simulated by models participating in the C4MIP of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). An independent estimate of the additional positive carbon-cycle climate feedbacks from permafrost thaw, which is not considered in most C4MIP models, is added. The estimates represent the mean and 5–95% range. Note that these feedbacks act through modifying the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and thus are not included in the definition of ECS, which assumes a doubling of CO2 , 4 but are included in the definition and assessed range of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE). {5.4.7, 5.4.8, Box 5.1, Figure 5.29, 6.4.5, Table 6.9, 7.4.2, Table 7.10}. Figure and caption text from the IPCC Assessment Report 6, Technical Summary, Figure TS.17 (Arias et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example for an important positive feedback arising from land biosphere processes is that of permafrost melting. As the climate warms, previously frozen soil that is very rich in organic matter content melts and the C becomes exposed to decomposers (heterotrophic soil bacteria and fungi). CO2 is produced. This climate warming-induced CO2 from melting permafrost amplifies the warming, which triggered it in the first place, due to its greenhouse effect - a positive feedback. Melting permafrost soil often becomes water-logged. The anaerobic conditions promote the production of methane (CH4) - an even stronger greenhouse gas than CO2. The positive feedback gets further amplified.\nThe land biosphere is connected with the Earth system through a multitude of positive and negative feedbacks, leading to complex interactions. While Earth System Models resolve many of these feedbacks and aid our understanding of the systems response to the anthropogenic forcing, translating these concepts into verbal and mental models of how climate change unfolds is challenging. A positive feedback is often described as a “vicious cycle” and sometimes vaguely conflated with a tipping point. A solid understanding of terrestrial biosphere processes, clear definitions, and a concise formalism, grounded on known physical relationships, helps to clarify concepts and the contextualization and communication of the risks of climate change. Chapter 13 will serve this purpose.\n\n\n1.1.5 Tipping points\nTipping points in the Earth system are points at which of a part of the Earth system transitions into a new state in response to a relatively small external forcing. They are inherently hard to predict using Earth System Models. Surprises cannot be excluded. Several potential tipping points have been identified in terrestrial systems (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022). Their reliable simulation in models relies on accurate models of processes in land ecosystems. Once more, land ecosystems and their response to climate change may be a critical element for the future of the Earth system. However, relatively large uncertainties remain for modelling key processes and further research is needed to consolidate the current understanding (and hand-drawn map) of potential tipping elements in the land biosphere (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The location of climate tipping elements in the cryosphere (blue), biosphere (green), and ocean/atmosphere (orange), and global warming levels at which their tipping points will likely be triggered. Figure and caption text from Armstrong McKay et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Carbon dixide removal through land ecosystems\nFor the climate to be stabilized at 1.5°C or 2.0°C, rapid and large CO2 emission cuts are needed. Alongside the reduction of fossil fuel combustion, climate stabilization scenarios rely - to a varying degree - on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Most CDR options deployed to date and available for scaling to meet climate stabilization needs rely on land ecosystems for sequestering (net uptake and long-term storage) additional C.  Afforestation and reforestation have been estimated to be a potent solution for climate change mitigation (Walker et al. 2022; Mo et al. 2023) and tree planting has moved to center stage in the public perception and in policy efforts to avert dangerous climate change. But can we rely on trees or other land ecosystems as a solution for the climate crisis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Roles of CDR in global or national mitigation strategies. Stylised pathway showing multiple functions of CDR in different phases of ambitious mitigation: (1) further reducing net CO2 or GHG emissions levels in near-term; (2) counterbalancing residual emissions to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions in the mid-term; (3) achieving and sustaining net-negative CO2 or GHG emissions in the long-term. Figure and caption text from IPCC Assessment Report 6, Working Group III, Cross-Chapter Box 8 (IPCC 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, ecological principles and multiple aspects of the role of land ecosystems and their interaction with climate and the carbon cycle have to be considered - apart from conflicts with biodiversity and sustainability goals and social, economic, and cultural aspects of land use (Deprez et al. 2024). For example, the carbon stored in a tree is susceptible to a range of threats, including wildfires, deforestation, and tree mortality by aggravating climatic stress (Anderegg et al. 2020). Moreover, surface properties, relevant for land-climate interactions, and their differences between forests and grasslands imply that forests may heat the local climate more than a grassland would - despite the additional C stored in a forest (Bala et al. 2007).\nUnderstanding the technical potential of land-based CDR will have to consider the full complexity of land-Earth system interactions. This course introduces these interactions.",

    "text": "2.1 A global view of vegetation\nWe start with the observation that the global distribution of plants and characteristic assemblies of different plant species is not random, but relates to climate. Around the beginning of the 19th century, Alexander von Humboldt pursued expeditions to different places on Earth and connected the multitude of his local observations into a global view of biogeography. He was the first to realize that vegetation zones along elevational gradients were shifted across different mountain ranges on different continents and located on different latitudes, and that the elevational and latitudinal patterns in vegetation were related to climate - in much the same way across the earth. This finding is visualised by the schematic scientific drawing in Figure 2.1. The figure illustrates, for example, that the treeline increases from the high northern latitudes of Lapland at 68\\(^\\circ\\)N to the Alps and Pyrenees at 42-46\\(^\\circ\\)N and to the Himalaya at 29-32\\(^\\circ\\)N. Or that the elevation at which Betula alba (birch) grows varies from 1000-2000 ft in Lapland, to 4000-5000 ft in the Alps, and about 15,000 ft in the Himalaya. Figure 2.1 also illustrates that the treeline doesn’t increase monotonically with decreasing latitude. Although not spelled out in the figure, this is a hint at the importance of water, along with temperature, for controlling vegetation. We’ll revisit this observation later in this book. Humboldt’s integration of globally distributed observations into his global view of climate as a driver of vegetation was pioneering and forms the basis of our modern approach to understanding and modelling global vegetation patterns and how they are influenced by climate change.\nFigure 2.1: Vegetation zones along elevation and latitude.

    "text": "2.2 Biomes\nToday’s geodata provides information on climate and vegetation properties with global coverage. This enables a global mapping of vegetation, filling in the blank spots between the local observations made by Alexander von Humboldt 200 years ago. Global patterns in the distribution of vegetation become apparent when grouping plants and plant functional types (see Section 2.3) into biomes or broad vegetation classes. A global map of biomes following the definition and global delineation by Olson et al. (2001) is given in Figure 2.2. The exact delineation and naming of biomes varies between different sources, but the main distinctions are shared among all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Fourteen biomes and the locations of sites representative for each biome (used below).\n\n\n\n\n\nEach biome is characterised by the types of dominant plants (plant functional types), their characteristics (traits), ecosystem structural and functional properties, and landscape processes (e.g., fire). Underlying all of this is the characteristic climate. The following biome classification (based on Bonan (2015) and slightly deviating from Olson et al. (2001)) can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nClick on the biome names below to open a tab that lists some key characteristics and provides a Walter-Lieth climate diagram for a representative site, located in that biome. The sites are locations where ecoystem water and carbon fluxes, along with meteorological variables, are measured. We will revisit data from these same sites in later chapters, then with a focus on water and carbon fluxes and the phenology. The locations of the sites are indicated on the map in Figure 2.2.\nWalter-Lieth climate diagrams show monthly climatologies of average temperature and precipitation on the same axis and scaled such that months where the blue curve (precipitation, mm month-1) is above the red curve (temperature, \\(^\\circ\\)C) indicates humid periods and the opposite relative curve positions indicates dry periods.

    "text": "2.3 Plant functional types\nEach biome is characterised by a typical assembly of plant functional types (PFT, Figure 2.13). PFTs are a grouping of plant species based on their key physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics. That is, we can distinguish between annual (mostly grasses and herbs) and perennial (mostly trees and shrubs) plants, between needle-leaved and broadleaved trees, and between deciduous and evergreen trees. A key physiological distinction can further be made between grasses following the C3 vs. the C4 photosynthetic pathway (see Chapter 4). Thereby, the bewildering diversity of the plant kingdom can be reduced to a small set of PFT. A common categorization distinguishes the following PFTs:\n\nneedle-leaved evergreen trees\nbroadleaved evergreen trees\nneedle-leaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved deciduous trees\nbroadleaved annuals (herbs)\nC3 grasses\nC4 grasses\n\nGlobal vegetation models use PFTs as their basic unit for distinguishing plants. The exact delineation of PFTs implemented in such models may vary from the list given above. Further distinctions may be made and are relevant in a global vegetation and carbon cycle modelling context. For example, only a relatively small subset of plants are known to associate with symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria that live in root nodules of the host plant (“N-fixing plants”, see also Chapter 9). This association is highly relevant for the N economy of the plant and its productivity and competitiveness under different levels of N availability.\nPlants can also be distinguished into the botanical classification of angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnnosperms (seed-producing plants that include conifers, cycads, and Ginkgo). The distinction between angiosperms and gymnosperms largely aligns with the distinction between needle-leaved and broadleaved plants (but see Ginkgo). The two groups are not only distinguished by their phylogenetic heritage, but also by essential characteristics that relate to the efficiency by which they photosynthesise and transpire water. Angiosperm leaves typically exhibit higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates and are thinner and shorter-lived than leaves of gymnosperms. These differences relate to differences in how the water transport system (plant hydraulics) is built. A larger number and a wider diameter of water transport organs in angiosperms enable a higher water conductivity - essential for sustaining higher photosynthetic rates than in gymnosperms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Assembly of plant functional types as a basis for biome classification",

    "section": "2.4 Traits",
    "text": "2.4 Traits\nThe physiological, morphological, and life history characteristics of different plants determine their productivity and competitiveness in a given climate. Such characteristics are referred to as plant functional traits, or often just traits. Plant species can be described by a set of traits and a subset of certain traits yields the distinction into PFTs described above: leaf habit (deciduous vs. evergreen), leaf form (needle-leaved vs. broadleaved), and the life history strategy distinguising annual vs. perennial. A range of additional traits are commonly described and investigated scientifically. Here, we will not consider additional ones. The concept of a plant functional trait is that it describes a largely immutable characteristic of a plant species that determines metabolic rates (photosynthesis, respiration) and their relationship to the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature), nutrient and water demand, and ultimately its demographic rates (growth, fecundity, mortality) and thus competitiveness.\nToday’s global distribution of species and biomes (assuming no intervention by human land use and forest management) is the outcome of competition and thus reflects the combination of plant functional traits that optimises competitiveness of a species under the present-day climate. The distribution of biomes and PFTs is thus a direct reflection of the climate.\nFor example, whether a region is dominated by deciduous or by evergreen trees and forests is determined by the benefits and costs for a plant of maintaining leaves year-round. Evergreen trees benefit from the ability to photosynthesise and gain carbon around the year. For example, in Mediterranean regions, although light levels are lower in winter than in summer, ample moisture and non-negligible light enables evergreen trees to assimilate carbon also during winter months. However, leaves and needles of evergreen plants have to be built for lasting several years. Such leaves are typically much thicker than those of deciduous trees and thus require more carbon per unit leaf area for their construction. The leaf mass per unit leaf area is commonly referred to as the leaf mass per area, LMA, and is an important additional plant trait as it is directly linked to a plant’s carbon balance. Over the leaf lifespan, the initial high construction costs of high-LMA leaves are outweighed by the additional carbon assimilation during periods when deciduous trees shed their leaves.\nLeaf-shedding of deciduous trees, in contrast, is a strategy to avoid having to build costly long-lasting leaves and maintaining them year-round (which also incurs an additional respiration cost, also in the form of carbon). Leaves are shed during periods when the climate is unfavourable for photosynthesis - during cold and dark winter months, or during excessively dry periods.\nNote that plant functional traits are often not entirely immutable. Instead, traits may vary also within a species and these variations are often driven by the environment. This is called acclimation. Such variations can even arise over the course of a season. For example, photosynthetic traits can rapidly acclimate to the large changes in light availability over the course of a year. Some traits are more plastic than others. For example, a tree is either needle-leaved or broadleaved. There is no continuum between the two leaf forms. In contrast, the nitrogen content per unit leaf mass is relatively plastic within a species.\nA changing environment changes the competitiveness of a given species, i.e., of a given trait combination. As a result, some traits may acclimate to some extent within a weeks to years. Over longer time scales, the altered demographic rates in a new climate affect the competitiveness of a species (even after some of its traits may have acclimated to a new climate) and ultimately shift demographic rates and the community composition. In grasslands, where the demographic cycle is short, such community composition changes may unfold over time scales of a few years. In forests, the longevity of an individual tree is on the order of decades to centuries and community composition changes unfold on correspondingly long time scale.",

    "text": "2.5 Global vegetation patterns\nThe biome classification is a way to discretize vegetation based on several characteristics (e.g., tree cover fraction). However, many of these characteristics describe observable variables that vary more or less gradually across environmental gradients and each of these variables can be mapped across the globe thanks to Earth observation data. These global patterns of different observable variables reflect how the climate influences vegetation structure and functioning across the globe (independent of a classification into biomes). In much of the remainder of this course, we will investigate these vegetation-climate relationships without considering the biome classification. These relationships are informative for understanding how different processes of terrestrial ecology, plant physiology, the carbon cycle, and land-climate interactions are driven by the environment and vary across the globe.\n\nVegetation heightLeaf area indexBiomassTree cover fraction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: The global distribution of vegetation height from Simard et al.

Therefore, the pixels for which data is used for visualising the vegetation height per biome is biased towards particularly tall vegetation in these areas. Consequently, the distribution of vegetation heights in the biome ‘Tundra’ appears implausibly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Annual maximum leaf area index, averaged over years 2000-2008.

A widely used distinction of vegetation types/land cover classes is that of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP, see Table 2.1). Vegetation types distinguish what can be seen from space and are thus amenable to remote-sensing based land cover classification. However, for example, different types of evergreen broadleaved forests are not distinguished (e.g., moist tropical, Mediterranean, and temperate evergreen broadleaved forests). Also, vegetation types/land cover classes distinguish land cover that is dominated by human activities (agricultural and urban), while biomes distinguish naturally occurring (i.e., without human influence) vegetation zones.

    "text": "2.7 Climate zones\nWhile the biome categorisation is based on plant functional types and reflects a mix of vegetation types and climate, the categorisation into vegetation types is independent of climate, but purely based on vegetation and land cover properties that can be sensed from space. In contrast to this approach, we may focus exclusively on the climate and distinguish climate zones. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Köppen 1884) is based on a hierarchical classification that separates climate based on the seasonality of monthly air temperature and precipitation. The climate zones are chosen such that they largely align with the biomes. For this, water availability during the main vegetation periods and temperature minima during winter and maxima during summer are recognized to be particularly influential for the composition of the vegetation and are considered for the Köppen-Geiger climate classification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Overview of the Köppen-Geiger climate classes including the defining criteria.

    "section": "2.8 Hillslope-scale heterogeneity",
    "text": "2.8 Hillslope-scale heterogeneity\nTopography shapes microclimates and drives small-scale variations in hydrology. In mountain regions, vegetation may thus vary strongly along small spatial scales - on the order of 10-103 m. This scale - from the river channel to the ridge - is referred to as the hillslope scale. In much the same way as climate drives vegetation across biomes, so it does across the hillslope scale. The incident solar radiation and - as a consequence of that - near-surface air temperatures are affected by the local slope, aspect, and shading by the surrounding topography. Soil moisture and the groundwater table depth are affected by lateral subsurface flow of water, driven by gradients in water potentials along topographical gradients. Subsurface water flow converges in depressions and concave terrain (e.g., in valley bottoms) and diverges in convex terrain. (e.g., on ridges and hilltops). As a consequence, the water table is shallow in valley bottoms and deep under ridges. Radiation and hydrology thus create microclimates and plant water availability conditions that are shaped by topography and variations in vegetation that are shaped by the microclimates and hydrological conditions.\nThese hillslope-scale variations “intersect” with the the background climate (average climate across larger spatial scales, on the order of 104-105 m). A shallow groundwater table and moist soils in valley bottoms can promote plant productivity in arid regions and seasons. In contrast, in a humid climate, a very shallow water table in valley bottoms inhibits plant productivity due to anaerobic conditions in waterlogged soils and the inability of roots to penetrate into permanently water-saturated soil. Similarly, the influence of radiation in promoting versus inhibiting plant productivity depends on the background climate. In cold climates of the high northern latitudes, the solar zenith angle is relatively also, even in mid-summer. This creates a strong influence of the local slope and aspect. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing slopes receive more radiation - a difference to north-facing slopes that can be critical for sustaining tree growth in high northern regions. In contrast, elevated incident solar radiation in south-facing slopes can aggravate water limitation and suppress vegetation productivity in more arid climates of the subtropics and mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.24: Hillslope effects on vegetation in different background climate zones.

Bottom-right: Radiation promoting vegetation on south-facing (sun-exposed) slopes in southwest Yukon, Canada (Source: photo by Ryan Danby, Queen’s University, Canada). Figure extracted from Fan et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate also varies along elevation due to thermodynamics and radiative transfer in the atmosphere - independent of the slope and aspect of the local terrain. Temperatures decline following the lapse rate in the troposphere, leading to a shift of vegetation zones along large elevational gradients. This phenomenon is depicted also in Humboldt’s drawings (Figure 2.1). Radiation levels are elevated at high altitudes due to a shorter path length of solar radiation travelling across the atmosphere and, consequently, a reduced attenuation of the radiation intensity. Atmospheric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen declines with elevation. This implies reduced respiration and an increased efficiency of photosynthesis.\nSmall-scale variations in vegetation may also be driven my variations in soil characteristics and bedrock lithology which influences drainage and soil chemistry (pH, nutrient availability). Where the ground is seasonally snow-covered, very small-scale terrain features (100-102) and dominant wind directions drive snow accumulation and dispersion, leading to substantial small-scale variations in maximum snow depth and the duration of seasonal snow cover - with implications for plants (Körner and Hiltbrunner 2021).",

    "text": "2.9 Species distribution modelling and ecological niche\nThe notion that climate drives vegetation and the distribution of plant species enables a prediction and mapping of the species occurrence across geographical space. Data on species presence and absence can be associated with multiple variables characterizing the abiotic environment (mostly climate) recorded for the same location. The resulting empirical patterns can be used for spatial modelling and predicting whether a species is likely to occur at a new location or even a novel climate Figure 2.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.25: Methodological approach to species distribution modelling and predicting to a novel climate. Figure from Svenning et al. (2011).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approach to species distribution modelling is fundamentally rooted in the ecological niche concept. As formulated by Hutchinson (1957; Araújo and Guisan 2006), each species has a fundamental niche that can be conceived as a domain in a multi-dimensional space defined by the environmental conditions. Environmental filtering yields the fundamental niche which is generally a subset of the Earth’s climate space (Figure 2.26). The actual, or realized niche is smaller as it is additionally constrained by biotic interactions with other species. Natural selection yields the realized niche. Several challenges for species distribution modelling exist (Zimmermann et al. 2010). For example, the species distribution is hardly ever in equilibrium with the environment, given that climate has been constantly changing (although not as rapidly as today for millions of years); topographic heterogeneity, climatic history, and ecological refugia affect the species distribution and how it varies under climate change; genetic adaptation can lead to populations within species that exhibit different responses to the environment; and niche stability over long time scales may be undermined not only by genetic adaptation, but also by physiological effects of CO2 which fundamentally alters photosynthesis and transpiration and will therefore shift water availability-related niche limits observed today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.26: Environmental filtering yields the fundamental niche.

    "text": "2.10 Temporal variations of vegetation\nSpatial patterns in vegetation are influenced by how climate varies across different areas. Similarly, changes in vegetation are influenced by how climate changes over time. Vegetation change at temporal scales of thousands of years is recorded, for example, by pollen deposited in layered sediments. Given that they are preserved and that the sediment layers can be dated, the vegetation composition over time can be reconstructed. An example is given for the Moossee, near Bern in Figure 2.27. The pollen diagram documents how vegetation on the Swiss Plateau unterwent several major changes since the last Glacial. At around 19 kyr BP, a steppe tundra established, replaced around 16 kyr BP by a shrub tundra. At around 15 kyr BP, a boreal forest established before it was replaced by a temperate mixed oak forest at the beginning of the Holocene - the current warm period at 11,600 yr BP. A beech-dominated temperate forest, as it is common for this region today, established around 8200 yr BP. Figure 2.27 also shows that these biome replacements coincided with rapid climatic shifts and that the vegetation change was largely instantaneous. This instantaneous response of species composition is interpreted as a reflection of the importance of glacial refugia from which a species may rapidly expand upon climate change (Rey et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.27: Pollen diagram from the Moossee, Switzerland. The diagram shows the percentage of pollen recorded over time (green areas). Cultural indicators and charcoal influx indicate the presence of humans in the region. Parallel variations observed from other data sources are also shown for interpretation: Millennial-scale variations in solar radiation, lake levels, and temperature reconstructions. Figure from Rey et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple vegetation reconstructions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) obtained from globally distributed locations provide a picture of how biomes were distributed across the Earth around 20 ka BP (Figure 2.29, bottom panel). The difference in climate and CO2 (global mean temperatures were around 6°C lower than at present; CO2 was at around 180 ppm, today it’s at over 420 ppm) caused forest biomes to recede and grasslands to expand across most of the globe. The upper panel of Figure 2.29 shows the simulated biome distribution. These simulation results are not based on a species distribution model, but on a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model that accounts for both climate and CO2 effects and simulates the distribution of PFTs from which biomes were derived here. The simulation of vegetation distribution at the level of PFTs instead of species is less affected by biotic interactions that are hard to simulate at global scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.28: The global distribution of biomes at the Mid-Holocene (6000 kyr BP).

Figure from I. C. Prentice, Harrison, and Bartlein (2011).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mapping of vegetation for past climates is enabled by the biomization of paleo-ecological records (I. Prentice et al. 1996). Classifying vegetation into biomes is useful for distilling ecological information beyond the anthropogenic impact. Biomes reflect a potential natural vegetation. The use of biomes is therefore important for designing conservation efforts suited for a specific climate (Olson et al. 2001), and is instructive for understanding environmental controls on ecosystem types as reflected by the agreement of biomes and climate zones (Section 2.7). Yet, to understand principles and mechanisms of how plant physiology, biogeochemical cycling, and land-climate interactions are shaped by the environment, we often don’t need to rely on a classification of vegetation. As we will learn in later chapters, the abiotic environment drives vegetation functioning in much the same way (bar some exceptions) through generally applicable physical laws across the whole terrestrial biosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nExplain the difference between biomes, as defined for example by Olson et al.

    "text": "3.1 The pre-industrial carbon cycle\nCarbon is an abundant element, present in all organic matter - matter produced by biota (living organisms) - and in inorganic forms in the atmosphere, the ocean, and the lithosphere. On land, the vast majority of C is present in organic forms in living biomass - mostly of vegetation (450 PgC) and soil organic matter (1700 PgC excluding permafrost). Of the latter, a particularly large stock of C is stored in permafrost soils (1200 PgC). In the ocean, the vast majority of C mass is present in inorganic forms, dissolved in ocean water, of which 900 PgC is stored in the surface ocean (the well-mixed top few hundred meters) and 37,100 PgC is stored in the deep ocean. Dissolved organic carbon in the ocean makes up 700 PgC and 1750 PgC are stored as carbonate shells in ocean floor sediments. In the pre-industrial Earth, 591 PgC were present as CO2 in the atmosphere.\nFigure 3.1: Global carbon (CO2) budget (2010–2019). Yellow arrows represent annual carbon fluxes (in PgC yr-1) associated with the natural carbon cycle, estimated for the time prior to the industrial era, around 1750. Pink arrows represent anthropogenic fluxes averaged over the period 2010–2019. The rate of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is equal to net land-use change emissions, including land management plus fossil fuel emissions, minus land and ocean net sinks (plus a small budget imbalance). Circles with yellow numbers represent pre-industrial carbon stocks in PgC. Circles with pink numbers represent anthropogenic changes to these stocks (cumulative anthropogenic fluxes) since 1750. The relative change of gross photosynthesis since pre-industrial times is based on 15 Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. The corresponding emissions by total respiration and fire are those required to match the net land flux, exclusive of net land-use change emissions which are accounted for separately. The cumulative change of anthropogenic carbon in the terrestrial reservoir is the sum of carbon cumulatively lost by net land-use change emissions, and net carbon accumulated since 1750 in response to environmental drivers (warming, rising CO2, nitrogen deposition). Figure from Canadell et al. (2021).\nUnder the relatively stable climate of the pre-industrial Holocene (11,700 yr BP - 1750 CE), the size of the C pools described above remained relatively stable. To simplify, we can conceive them as constant (at steady state) under the pre-industrial Holocene climate. This is a simplification. For example, millennial-scale trends in solar radiation inputs over the seasons and latitudes (driven by slight changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun), caused climate and vegetation changes that were substantial and in certain cases abrupt (e.g., the demise of the Green Sahara between around 6-3 ka BP (Shanahan et al. 2015)).\nEven under such a pre-industrial steady state, C fluxes between the major reservoirs or pools (atmosphere, ocean, land) persisted. This is indicated in Figure 3.1 by the wide orange arrows pointing up and down between the land and the atmosphere and between the ocean and the atmosphere, as well as between different pools within the ocean. In a steady state, the C flux from the atmosphere into the land roughly equals the flux from the land to the atmosphere, and the net exchange flux is zero. Hence, the pool sizes remain constant in spite of the ongoing exchange fluxes between them. We speak of a dynamic equilibrium.",

    "text": "3.2 Carbon pool dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1st-order decay model\n\n\n\nThe concept of pools and fluxes is central for describing and modelling the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles in the environment. The dynamics of a pool \\(C(t)\\) is given by the balance of the flux of C into that pool \\(I(t)\\) and the flux \\(O(t)\\) leaving the pool - over time \\(t\\). In general terms, we can write the temporal change of the pool size as\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I(t) - O(t) \\;.\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nTo simplify the expressions, we will omit \\((t)\\) below. But remember, that the fluxes and pools vary with time. The assumption that the out-flux \\(O\\) scales linearly with the size of the pool \\(C\\) is a good simplifying description (i.e., a model) for many processes in the environment. For example, the amount of CO2 produced by the decomposition (decay) of organic matter in the soil scales roughly linearly with the amount of organic matter that is being respired. This leads to the 1st-order decay model of pool dynamics:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - kC \\;.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Here, \\(k\\) is a decay constant and is in units of the inverse of time. In other words, it specifies the fraction of \\(C\\) decaying per unit time (e.g,. seconds, or years). The higher \\(k\\), the more rapidly the pool decays. For the case of \\(I=0\\), we get \\(\\mathrm{d}C/\\mathrm{d}t = -kC\\). This is a differential equation and can be understood as: What is the function that yields itself, multiplied by \\(-k\\), when taking its derivative with respect to time? The solution is:\n\\[\nC(t) = C_0 \\; e^{-kt} \\;.\n\\] For example, following this model, the pool of C in soil organic matter would decay exponentially if inputs (litterfall) were zero. The decay constant \\(k\\) determines how long it takes for it to be reduced by a certain factor. A commonly used factor is 0.5. We can calculate a half-life - the time \\(t\\) at which \\(C(t) = 0.5\\;C_0\\).\nIn a dynamic equilibrium the change in the pool size \\(C\\) is by definition zero. \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 \\;.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Combining Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3 and re-arranging terms leads to the steady-state pool size as a function of the in-flux and the decay constant \\(k\\). \\[\nC^\\ast = I/k\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Here, the asterisk denotes that \\(C\\) is at steady-state. This solution indicates two aspects. First, the size of the steady-state pool is proportional to the input flux. Note that we assumed that the input flux itself has no dependency on \\(C\\). Second, the size of the steady-state pool is inversely proportional to the decay constant. That is, the faster the decay, the smaller the steady state pool.\nEquation 3.2 can also be expressed in terms of an average lifetime or turnover time \\(\\tau\\), instead of \\(k\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - C/\\tau \\;.\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nConsider the C pool of the intermediate and deep sea (37,100 PgC) in Figure 3.1 (bottom right). What is the turnover time of C in that pool?\nExpress the steady-state pool size \\(C^\\ast\\) as a function of the in-flux and the turnover time \\(\\tau\\).\nExpress the half-life constant as a function of \\(k\\).\nDo you know about other processes in nature that can be described by the 1st-order decay model?\n\n\n\nWith the information in Figure 3.1 about pool sizes and steady-state gross fluxes (parallel input and output fluxes), and our model of pool dynamics, we get an insight about how fast C is cycling in and out of different pools. \\(k=I/C^\\ast\\) is a measure of this cycling rate. Or expressed in terms of its inverse, the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) measures how long a C atom resides in that pool. Table 3.1 documents the turnover times for major pools of the global carbon cycle. The small C burial fluxes into sediments on land and on the ocean floor are the supply of what is eventually converted into the very large pool of C in carbonate rock (limestone). A small fraction of the C burial flux is in the form of organic matter, including dead plants, algae, and other microorganisms. Under high heat and pressure, a fraction of it contributes to the formation of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas - fossil fuels. The discrepancy in turnover times between the lithosphere C pool and the other pools indicates that C cycles on vastly different time scales and the slow geological C cycle is largely disconnected from “fast” C cycle between the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere. Reflecting this discrepancy in time scales, the geological C cycle is not depicted in Figure 3.1 and C in fossil fuel reservoirs is treated as an external input to the fast C cycle.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Pre-industrial pool sizes, input fluxes, and turnover times of major pools of the global carbon cycle. The preindustrial input flux into the atmosphere is calculated as the sum of fluxes from volcanism, total respiration and fire, freshwater, and ocean-atmosphere gas exchange from Figure 3.1. The input flux into the surface ocean is the sum of ocean-atmosphere gas exchange and the flux from intermediate and deep sea. The flux from marine biota is not additional to the ocean-atmosphere exchange flux. The pool size of the biosphere is taken as the sum of vegetation and soils. The permafrost C pool is relatively inert. The size of the lithosphere C pool includes C in the form of sedimentary (carbonate) rocks and kerogens (solid, insoluble organic matter in sedimentary rocks). Its estimate is based on Falkowski et al. (2000). The input flux into the lithosphere is calculated as the sum of burial on land, rock weathering, and ocean floor sedimentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPool\nPool size (PgC)\nInput flux (PgC yr-1)\nTurnover time (yr)\n\n\n\n\nAtmosphere\n591\n167.3\n3.5\n\n\nSurface ocean\n900\n329\n2.7\n\n\nDeep ocean\n37,000\n(see exercise 3.1)\n(see exercise 3.1)\n\n\nBiosphere\n2150\n113\n19\n\n\nLithosphere\n75,000,000\n0.7\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the turnover time \\(\\tau\\) describes the average time that an atom of C resides in the respective pool. This is a simplification. In the C pool ‘terrestrial biosphere’, not every C atom has the same probability of being oxidized and respired as CO2. Hence, in reality, \\(\\tau\\) is a wide distribution, ranging from seconds to years for non-structural carbon derived from photosynthesis, decades to centuries for C in woody biomass, and to millennia for a small fraction of soil organic matter, especially if the C is protected from oxidation, for example in water-logged soils. The turnover time should therefore be understood as a diagnostic, useful for describing the average systems dynamics in a simplified way, and subsuming multiple processes that operate at different time scales, contributing to different portions of C conversion to CO2.\nThe range of turnover times (e.g., within the terrestrial biosphere) arise because C is transferred between multiple pools within the biosphere and the ocean. Going to the next more detailed level of abstraction (model representation), multiple C pools in terrestrial ecosystems can be distinguished (e.g., non-structural C, leaves, roots, wood, litter, soil organic matter, microbes). Some C “cascades” through multiple pools, some is quickly respired back into the atmosphere. The interpretation that \\(k\\) equals the inverse of the turnover time \\(\\tau\\), and that the turnover time equals the mean age of all C atoms in that pool, and that the mean transit time (the time it takes between an atom of C entering a pool until it exits that pool again) equals \\(\\tau\\) is only valid for certain cases, and not for “C cascades” with fluxes between multiple pools. Requirements are that we’re dealing with a single well-mixed pool, that this pool is at steady-state, that it has been so for an infinitely long time, that \\(I\\) and \\(k\\) are constant over time, and the flux leaving the pool is a linear function of the pool size (\\(O=kC\\)) (Sierra et al. 2017). The transit time is the same as residence time - a term used more commonly in hydrology.",

    "text": "3.3 The anthropogenic perturbation\nAlthough fossil fuels are formed by natural processes of the C cycle, their combustion can be regarded as an external input of C into the (modern) global C cycle. This is because the time scale at which the reservoir of fossil fuels is depleted (102 yr) stands in stark contrast to the time scale at which it was formed (108 yr, see turnover time of C in the lithosphere in Table 3.1). The C is added in the form of CO2 to the atmosphere from where it is taken up by the ocean through diffusion and equilibration of the ocean surface water’s CO2 partial pressure with the atmosphere’s CO2 partial pressure, and by the terrestrial biosphere through photosynthesis. It is important to note that CO2 in the atmosphere does not decay through physical or chemical processes, nor are there C sinks on land or in the ocean that remove C away from the “fast” C cycle - except the burial into sediments (see Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1). However the magnitude of the burial fluxes are dwarfed by the magnitude of C inputs through the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Hence, the present-day C emissions drive an accumulation of the total amount of C cycling in the “fast” C cycle and the added C gets redistributed between the spheres. The net fluxes from the atmosphere into land ecosystems and the ocean arise because the total terrestrial and oceanic C pools are increasing as CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere and the atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising. In subsequent chapters (Chapter 4 and Chapter 11), we will learn about the processes driving the CO2 uptake by land and ocean and the dynamics of the C redistribution in the Earth system. In this chapter, we will look at the global C budget - how much C has been emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation and how much of this C has accumulated in the atmosphere and how much has been taken up by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere?\nThe global C budget can be defined for globally aggregated fluxes as the balance between emissions from fossil fuels \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) and land use change \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) on the left side of the equation and the redistribution of C among the atmosphere, land and ocean. \\(G_\\mathrm{atm}\\) is the atmospheric growth rate, \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) is the net ocean C uptake (also referred to as the ocean sink) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is the net land C uptake (or land sink). A net flux from the atmosphere into the ocean or into land C storage is positive.\n\\[\nE_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} = G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nThis terminology is adopted from the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2023) and is expressed as global annual total fluxes. The separation of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) is not straight-forward, but can be understood in a simplified fashion as spatially separated fluxes, whereby the land sink occurs only on areas that are not affected by land use change (LUC). In reality, LUC affects the land sink which complicates a separation of the two components. This is further resolved in Chapter 14.\nThe values of the global carbon budget components are given in Figure 3.1 for an average across years 2010-2019, where \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\) corresponds to the ‘net ocean flux’ and \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) corresponds to the the ‘net land flux’ in Figure 3.1. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) corresponds to ‘net land-use change’. The ‘net’ indicates that \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) is the net effect between CO2 emissions from deforestation and C uptake by re-growing forests and afforestations. Note that the annual atmospheric growth rate is not resolved in Figure 3.1. The most recent update of the global carbon budget from Friedlingstein et al. (2023) is given in Table 3.2 as 10-year averages of annual fluxes for years 2013-2022 and cumulative fluxes for the industrial era - years 1750-2022.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Global carbon budget (in PgC and PgC yr-1) from the 2023 update by Friedlingstein et al.

Values reported by Friedlingstein et al. (2023) include the cement carbonation sink. Without that sink, the value of \\(E_\\mathrm{FF}\\) for 2022 would be about 0.2 PgC yr-1 higher. \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) estimates are based on land-use and land-use change data from national statistics and forest carbon “bookkeeping models”. These models use information about vegetation C stocks, forest C re-growth curves, and the fate of C after deforestation and harvesting (e.g., wood products lifetime). Atmospheric CO2 concentration, and hence the accumulation of C in the atmosphere, is measured directly and bears the least uncertainty among all carbon budget components. The ocean sink is estimated from global ocean CO2 uptake models and observation-based products. In Friedlingstein et al. (2023), the land sink is estimated from dynamic global vegetation models.\nAdvances in observations and modelling in recent years now enable the land and ocean sink to be estimated in a “bottom-up fashion” - using models of land and ocean C uptake. Since every component of the global carbon budget is thereby estimated independently, a budget imbalance term \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) can be defined. A value of zero indicates that models of the land and ocean C uptake exactly match the (better known) emission terms minus the atmospheric growth rate. \\[\nB_\\mathrm{IM} = E_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC} - (G_\\mathrm{atm} + S_\\mathrm{ocean} + S_\\mathrm{land})\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nToday, the global carbon budget is well specified thanks to reliable estimates of its individual components. The budget imbalance is only a fraction of the total emissions. Until recently, “bottom-up” estimates of \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) by land C cycle models were deemed insufficient for providing reliable estimates. Instead, \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) was estimated as the budget residual by neglecting \\(B_\\mathrm{IM}\\) and rearranging terms in Equation 3.7 to solve for \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\). In fact, when the IPCC First Assessment Report was published in 1990, the existence of C sink on land was not known and it was treated as the budget imbalance and referred to as the ‘missing sink’. It was stated that “there are possible processes on land which could account for the missing CO2 (but it has not been possible to verify them)”.\nIt was only later that the existence of a terrestrial C sink could be more firmly established and quantified thanks to parallel measurements of the atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations (Keeling, Piper, and Heimann 1996). (In fact, the ratio O2/N2 is measured to avoid the much larger measurement uncertainty in absolute O2 measurements). The ratios of O2:CO2 are known from the stoichiometric molecular formulae for photosynthesis (O2:CO2 = 1.1), fossil fuel combustion (O2:CO2 = 1.4) and ocean uptake (O2:CO2 = 0). An ocean O2 source from marine organisms has to be factored in. Given the total C emissions from fossil fuel combustion, the net land C balance can thus be calculated and the calculation visualized geometrically (Figure 3.2). Note that net emissions from land use change are not considered and the what is termed the “Sland” in Figure 3.2 is actually the net \\((S_\\mathrm{land} - E_\\mathrm{LUC})\\) in Equation 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Global land and ocean carbon sinks deduced from changes in atmospheric CO2 and O2 concentrations. The figure is an updated version of Fig. 2 from Keeling, Piper, and Heimann (1996), taken from a recent update of the atmospheric carbon and oxygen budget by Li et al. (2022). In this figure, what is termed ‘Sland’ corresponds to (Sland - ELUC) as defined in Equation 3.6.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a mathematical sense, the constraint from atmospheric oxygen can be understood as a second equation, necessary for solving for two unknowns \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) and \\(S_\\mathrm{ocean}\\). Their sum must equal (well-known) emissions \\(E_\\mathrm{FF} + E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) minus the atmospheric growth rate \\(G_\\mathrm{atm}\\). This yields only one equation - that for the C budget (Equation 3.6). The oxygen budget provides a second equation and thus enables solving for two unknowns. In a similar fashion, the isotopic composition of C (the ratio of 13C:12C) also provides a second equation (Joos and Bruno 1998). The history of 13C can be measured on ice cores and \\((S_\\mathrm{land} - E_\\mathrm{LUC})\\) can thus be reconstructed for the past (Figure 3.3). Note that in order to separate \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) from the budget, independent estimates of \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Top panel: Cumulative C uptake by the land biosphere over the past 11 kyr. The grey shaded area indicates uncertainty from ice core measurements. Bottom panel: Atmospheric CO2 concentration (grey squares and modelled atmospheric CO2 based on scenarios of drivers of past millennial-scale C cycle changes (green: land biosphere is the only driver, black: land biopshere, combined with effects by oceanic carbonate chemistry due to Holocene land C uptake, red: land biosphere, combined with effects by oceanic carbonate chemistry due to Holocene and pre-Holocene land C uptake). Figure from Elsig et al. (2009).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can adopt the perspective of C cycle science stated in earlier publications. Falkowski et al. (2000) wrote: “Direct determination of changes in terrestrial carbon storage has proven extremely difficult. Rather, the contribution of terrestrial ecosystems to carbon storage is inferred from changes in the concentrations of atmospheric gases, especially CO2 and O2 […].” In that sense, let’s consider the land sink to be the budget residual and assume that the ocean sink estimate is accurate (indeed, its uncertainty is only about half the uncertainty in bottom-up land sink estimates, Table 3.2). Visually contrasting emissions and their redistribution reveals an interesting pattern (Figure 3.4). The substantial year-to-year (interannual) variations in the land sink are almost exclusively responsible for interannual variations in the atmospheric growth rate. Total emissions and the ocean sink exhibit little interannual variation. By definition, the sum of the atmospheric growth rate, land and ocean sink is equal to the sum of emissions from fossil fuels and land use change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nUse Equation 3.7 to express the land sink as the budget residual (assuming \\(B_\\mathrm{IM} = 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Data from Friedlingstein et al. 2023.

    "text": "3.4 Understanding the land C sink\n\n3.4.1 Processes\nAs challenging as it was to locate the “missing C sink” in the terrestrial biosphere in the 1990s (see above), it remains a great challenge to locate the C sink within the terrestrial biosphere and attribute it to processes. Three processes are considered to be particularly influential for the terrestrial C balance, and they each affect ecosystems’ C balances in different regions across the globe - land use change, the relief of temperature limitations on photosynthesis and growth, and the CO2 fertilization effect.\nThe land C balance from land use change is the net of a flux to the atmosphere due to deforestation and a flux from the atmosphere to the land biosphere due to regrowth after deforestation. Land use change trends are very different across regions globally. While large C losses due to land use change are currently occurring in the tropics, northern extra-tropical regions generally gain C as forests are recovering from more intense wood harvesting in the past - prior the the mid-20th century. Chapter 14 delves deeper into the role of land use change on the carbon cycle and climate. The net C flux from land use change is accounted for in the global carbon budget by the term \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\) (Equation 3.6) and should reflect also effects by C accumulation in recovering forests. However, past land use changes are uncertain and the impact of pre-1950 wood harvesting in temperate regions may be underestimated by models that supply estimates for \\(E_\\mathrm{LUC}\\). \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\), when defined as the budget residual, may thus be driven by the C sink in recovering forests. A recent estimate suggests that about a quarter of the land sink, or 1.3 PgC yr-1, is due to recovery from past forest disturbances (fire, wind, and wood harvesting) (Pugh et al. 2019).\nWarming trends due to anthropogenic climate change are relieving temperature limitations on photosynthesis and tree growth, enabling an extension of the growing season (Ruehr et al. 2023), and an expansion of forest areas and vegetation greenness in high northern latitudes - as sensed from space (T. F. Keenan and Riley 2018). The associated land C sink, as the one driven by forest recovery from past land use change, is located in the northern extra-tropics.\nRising atmospheric CO2 stimulates leaf-level photosynthetic rates. The additional C assimilated likely drives increases in ecosystem C storage. However, a multitude of processes and ecosystem feedbacks are involved and affect the link between the leaf-level CO2-fertilization of photosynthesis and ecosystem-level C storage (nutrient limitation, tree longevity reduction due to accelerated growth, soil organic C loss due to plant-soil interactions). Free-Air-CO2-Experiments, where plots of outdoor growing vegetation are exposed to elevated CO2 during multiple years indicate a stimulation of photosynthesis and growth, but evidence for gains in biomass and soil C stocks is mixed. Yet, C gains in mature forest growth, biomass, and ecosystem C stocks are documented and, particularly in the tropics, CO2-fertilization appears to be the main driver of this trend. This is consistent with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models that attribute about 60-85% of the total land sink to CO2-fertilization (Schimel, Stephens, and Fisher 2015; Trevor F. Keenan et al. 2016). Published review studies (Ruehr et al. 2023; Walker et al. 2021) provide a more detailed account of the complex role of CO2-fertilization in driving the land C sink.\nTheory suggests that the CO2 effect on photosynthesis should be higher under warm than under cold temperatures. Therefore, a CO2-driven land sink should be strongest in the tropics. As mentioned above, a C sink that is driven predominantly by either growing season extensions and cold limitation reliefs or by recovery from past land use change would be located mainly in the northern extra-tropics. How to discriminate between these drivers and their associated C sink regions? Once more, atmospheric CO2 measurements provide a constraint. While the total terrestrial C sink is relatively well-constrained through the global carbon budget, contributions from the tropics (and southern hemisphere) vs. the northern extra-tropics requires an additional constraint. Atmospheric CO2 measurements, in combination with known CO2 sources and their location and with atmospheric transport fields (atmospheric inversions) enable a split of the global land C sink into contribution from the two regions, while their sum is constrained by the global carbon budget. This approach is visualized in Figure 3.5. The combination of the two constraints indicates that model simulations where the CO2-fertilization effect was “turned off” tend to be outside the range of plausible combinations of tropical and northern-extratropical land C sinks. This indicates the importance of a strong CO2-fertilization-driven C sink in the tropics. Hence, the hypothesis that the land C sink is driven exclusively by forest recovery from past land use and the extension of the growing season in cold-limited regions of the northern extra-tropics is not compatible with the C budget and the inter-hemispheric split of land C uptake inferred from atmospheric inversions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: The anti-correlation of the northern extra-tropical and the tropical-plus-southern land C sink. Atmospheric inversions from different sources (red and purple points and squares) indicate an anti-correlation of the regional sinks, constrained by the C mass balance from the global carbon budget: The sum of regional land C sinks must equal the total terrestrial C sink from the global carbon budget. Several Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) without the CO2-fertilisation effect (white triangles) lie outside the range constrained by the global C mass balance, while DGVMs with the CO2-fertilisation effect considered are better compatible with the budget. Figure from Schimel, Stephens, and Fisher (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe processes for understanding the oceanic C sink will be introduced in Chapter 11.\n\n\n3.4.2 Interannual variability\nAs highlighted above, pointing to Figure 3.4, the magnitude of the land C sink varies strongly between years. Semi-arid regions, where dry conditions during a substantial part of the year limit photosynthesis and where drought-related disturbances strongly influence ecosystem C balances, are contributing most strongly to the signal apparent from the global C budget (Ahlström et al. 2015). Semi-arid regions largely align with temperate and tropical grasslands, savannahs, and shrubland biomes (Figure 2.2). Years with a small land sink and a high atmospheric CO2 growth rate are dry years, associated with low global-scale terrestrial water storage (Humphrey et al. 2018), and are associated with warm temperature anomalies in the tropics (Cox et al. 2013). This indicates two important points. First, C storage in the terrestrial biosphere is highly susceptible to climate variations. Second, water availability has a strong control on the terrestrial carbon cycle. We will learn more about how the water and the carbon cycles are coupled in Chapter 7 and how the influence of water availability on vegetation varies across the globe in Chapter 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Interannual variability of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate (CGR) and terrestrial water storage (TWS). (a) Monthly de-seasonalized and de-trended CGR, TWS from gravimetric satellite observations (GRACE mission) and TWS from a statistical model that reconstructs the TWS based on climate data (GRACE-REC).

(b) Yearly CGR versus GRACE TWS anomalies. Figure and caption text from Humphrey et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 trajectories and the land C cycle response\n\n\n\nEquation 3.2 describes the dynamics of land C storage based on a 1-box model. Let’s apply this model for understanding the link between changes in \\(I\\) and the land C balance (\\(\\mathrm{d}C/\\mathrm{d}t\\)). We explore different future trajectories of atmospheric CO2, branching off from its observed history, and simulate the resulting total terrestrial photosynthetic CO2 uptake (also referred to as the gross primary productivity, see also Chapter 4), the terrestrial C pool, and the land sink (i.e., the temporal change in the terrestrial C pool).\nWe make the (strong) assumption that the land C balance dynamics are exclusively driven by the CO2-fertilization effect on photosynthetic C uptake, represented by \\(I\\), while the turnover rate (\\(\\tau\\)) remains constant. The CO2-fertilization effect on a variable \\(x\\) is commonly measured as the sensitivity factor \\(\\beta\\): \\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\ln (x/x_0)}{\\ln (c_a/c_{a,0})}\n\\tag{3.8}\\] Here, \\(c_a\\) is the atmospheric CO2 concentration (ambient CO2). For ratios of \\(x/x_0\\) and \\(c_a/c_{a,0}\\) approaching 1, Equation 3.8 is equivalent to the ratio of the relative change in \\(x\\) over the relative change in CO2. \\[\n\\beta \\approx \\frac{\\Delta x/x}{\\Delta c_a/c_a}\\;,\n\\tag{3.9}\\] where \\(\\Delta x = x - x_0\\). The sensitivity of the total terrestrial photosynthetic CO2 uptake to atmospheric CO2 has been estimated by T. F. Keenan et al. (2023) as \\(\\beta = 0.59 \\pm 0.16\\). With this, we can model \\(I\\) as a function of \\(c_a\\) using Equation 3.9.\nThe 1-box model can be implemented numerically by discretization in time (i.e., considering time steps \\(\\Delta t\\)). To simulate the terrestrial C pool over time (\\(C(t)\\)), Equation 3.2 can thus be written as \\[\nC(t+\\Delta t) = C(t) + I(t) - \\tau^{-1}C(t)\n\\]\nWe further assume that \\(C(t)\\) was at steady-state in year 1850 - the first year of the CO2 time series used here. \\(\\tau\\) could be estimated by using values of terrestrial C pools (sum of vegetation C and soil C) and the gross photosynthesis flux from Figure 3.1 (\\(\\tau = (450\\; \\mathrm{GtC} + 1700\\; \\mathrm{GtC})/113\\; \\mathrm{GtC\\;yr}^{-1} = 19.0 \\; \\mathrm{yr}\\)). However, the resulting land C sink would be strongly overestimated when compared to the residual sink \\(S_\\mathrm{land}\\) from the Global Carbon Budget. When choosing \\(\\tau = 9 \\; \\mathrm{yr}\\), a better fit between the 1-box model-derived land sink and the observed land sink emerges. This could indicate that CO2-fertilization drives additional C storage that is more short lived than on average in vegetation and soil biomass. It probably also indicates that not all of the C assimilated by photosynthesis stays in the system for more than a few minutes to weeks. A substantial fraction of that C is respired by plants (autotrophic respiration, see also Chapter 4) before it is synthesized into longer-lived plant tissue biomass. The resulting evolution(s) of the land C cycle are illustrated in Figure 3.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: Evolution of the land C cycle in response to alternative (schematic) trajectories of future CO2. The green line in panels of the bottom row indicates the observed land sink, derived as the residual of the Global Carbon Budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nExpress \\(I\\) as a function of \\(c_a\\), using the definition of \\(\\beta\\) from Equation 3.9, and using \\(c_{a,0}\\) and \\(I_0\\).\nCalculate \\(I(c_a)\\) for \\(c_a = 400\\) ppm and \\(I_0\\) as the pre-industrial value of total terrestrial gross photosynthesis from Figure 3.1 and using the value of \\(\\beta\\) (mean) from T. F. Keenan et al. (2023).\nIt is important to note that the land C sink trajectories are strongly dependent on whether the dominating process driving it is CO2 fertilization or forest recovery from past disturbance (or other drivers).

    "text": "4.1 Light use efficiency model\nMonteith (1972) made the observation that the biomass productivity of a given (well-watered) crop (in the tropics) scales linearly with the amount of absorbed solar radiation, integrated over weeks to months. This observation underlies the general light use efficiency (LUE) model which describes ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis (referred to as gross primary production, GPP) as the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) and the efficiency at which photons are used for assimilating C (LUE). \\[\n\\mathrm{GPP} = \\mathrm{PPFD} \\cdot \\mathrm{fAPAR} \\cdot \\mathrm{LUE}\n\\tag{4.1}\\] GPP is expressed as a C flux per unit ground area and per unit time (e.g., gC m-2 s-1). PPFD measures the solar radiation flux, incident at the top of the canopy. It is expressed, e.g., in units of mol (photons) m-2 s-1. The light use efficiency model (Equation 4.1) is also often formulated using the photosynthetically active (solar) radiation (PAR) in units of an energy flux per unit ground area (e.g., W m-2), instead of PPFD. This is equivalent to the expression with respect to PPFD, considering that each photon (light quantum) bears a certain amount of radiation energy (see, e.g., here). fAPAR is the fraction (unitless) of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. It depends on the total ecosystem-level (or canopy-level) surface area of green leaves (Section 4.2). LUE is the light use efficiency, measuring the efficiency with which photons are harvested and used for assimilating CO2 by the photosynthetic machinery (Section 4.3). It is expressed, e.g., in units of gC (mol CO2)-1. See Table 4.1 for an overview of symbols and abbreviations used in this chapter.\nOf course, a relationship with biomass productivity, as observed by Monteith (1972) should not be equated with a relationship with GPP. However, again, over longer periods of time, a given plant converts assimilated carbon into biomass at a relatively constant rate (see Chapter 5). Therefore, the observation by Monteith (1972) is instructive for our understanding. Indeed, models of terrestrial GPP are often formulated in the form of Equation 4.1 and are useful for estimating how GPP values over space and time (at the scale of weeks to months). The aspect that the observations by Monteith (1972) were made under well-watered conditions is a further caveat. However, it shall serve us in this chapter as we are - for now - ignoring the effects by limited root-zone water availability. We will relieve this simplification in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.\nThe linear dependence of GPP on PPFD implies that the variations of solar radiation over the seasons and across latitude directly translate to how GPP varies across these scales. This will be further described in Chapter 6. Note that at shorter time scales, GPP is no longer linearly related to PAR. Through its influence on GPP, as described by Equation 4.1, solar radiation is the “engine” of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems. Temporal and spatial patterns of GPP are strongly driven by patterns in solar radiation. The astronomical mechanics responsible for temporal and spatial (latitudinal) patterns in solar radiation will be introduced in Chapter 6. For now, let’s remember that the incoming (incident) solar radiation is an energy flux that varies strongly over the course of a day and a year. These diurnal and seasonal patterns are different along different latitudes (position north or south of the Equator). In the following, we delve deeper into the two factors fAPAR and LUE in Equation 4.1.",

    "section": "4.2 Canopy light absorption",
    "text": "4.2 Canopy light absorption\nPhotosynthetic CO2 uptake only operates if active (green) leaves are out. The relationship between the amount of leaves and GPP is introduced here. Active leaf area varies across the seasons and space in response to the seasonality of temperature, light and water availability. The seasonal fluctuation of leaf area, most visible for deciduous trees, is referred to as (leaf) phenology. The drivers of temporal and spatial variations of phenology and leaf area are introduced in Section 6.2.\nThe fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) increases with the projected (one-sided) surface area of leaves per unit ground area (the leaf area index, LAI). The total surface area of leaves is roughly twice the projected surface area. The LAI is an ecosystem-level variable and reflects the leaf area density of the whole canopy. The canopy may be composed of multiple species and organised in multiple canopy layers (Figure 4.1). While temperate and boreal forests commonly form a single understorey and attain LAI values of 4-6 m2 m-1, tropical moist forests may have multiple canopy layers and an LAI of over 6 m2 m-1 (Figure 2.16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Vertical profile of the leaf area index (LAI) and light absorption the canopy for a typical oak forest, where most leaves are located in a dense canopy without an understorey. Figure from Bonan (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the intensity of shortwave (solar) radiation is highest at the top of the canopy, it is progressively attenuated as it penetrates into the canopy. Radiation gets reflected, absorbed and transmitted by individual leaves. The penetration of radiation into a canopy is referred to as canopy radiative transfer. Each of the processes - reflection, absorption, and transmittance - affects light differently in different wavelengths, depends on the solar zenith angle, on the three-dimensional arrangement of leaves in the canopy (angles, “clumping”), and on the pigments on the leaf surfaces that are responsible for light absorption. Pigments change across species and may vary in response to stress (e.g., by frost, heat, or water limitation).\nIn brief, canopy radiative transfer is complex. A simple model for how (solar) radiation (light) is attenuated as it penetrates into the canopy is given by the Beer-Lambert law. To apply it for canopy radiative transfer, we assume that a leaf only absorbs light, but does not reflect or transmit it. Following this model, the light intensity \\(I\\) at the bottom of the canopy (\\(z_0\\)) is an exponential function of LAI (\\(L\\)). The rate of decline of the light intensity is given by the light extinction coefficient \\(k\\). A typical value of \\(k\\) in the visible (photosynthetically active) wavelength spectrum is 0.5. \\[\nI(z_0) = I_0 \\; e^{-kL}\n\\] We have assumed that no light is reflected. Therefore the reduction of light levels at the bottom of the canopy tells us how much light was absorbed by the canopy (and used for photosynthesis). The fraction of absorbed (photosynthetically active) radiation therefore is \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{fAPAR} &= 1 - I(z_0)/I_0 \\\\\n               &= 1 - e^{-kL}\\;.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe shape of this function is illuatrated in Figure 4.2 (a). This implies a dependency of light levels on canopy depth \\(z\\), as illustrated in Figure 4.2 (b) - consistent with the observation shown in Figure 4.1 (b).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncalc_fapar &lt;- function(lai, k_beer){\n  1 - exp(-k_beer * lai)\n}\n\ngg_fapar &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_function(\n    fun = calc_fapar, \n    args = list(k_beer = 0.5),\n    linewidth = 0.75\n    ) +\n  xlim(0, 10) +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"LAI (m\"^2, \" m\"^-2, \")\")),\n       y = \"fAPAR (unitless)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ncalc_cumlai &lt;- function(z){\n  ifelse(z &lt;= 3.5, z*4.6/3.5, 4.6)\n}\n\ncalc_light_rel &lt;- function(z, k_beer){\n  exp(-k_beer * calc_cumlai(z))\n}\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(z = seq(0, 7, by = 0.01)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    light_rel = calc_light_rel(z, k_beer = 0.5)\n    )\n\ngg_canopydepth &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_rect(\n    aes(\n      xmin = 0, xmax = 1,\n      ymin = 0, ymax = 3.5\n    ),\n    fill = \"#009E73\",\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_rect(\n    aes(\n      xmin = 0.45, xmax = 0.55,\n      ymin = 3.5, ymax = 7\n    ),\n    fill = \"sienna\",\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = df,\n    aes(\n      y = z,\n      x = light_rel),\n    linewidth = 1,\n    color = \"#E69F00\"\n  ) +\n  labs(y = \"Canopy depth (m)\",\n       x = \"Light level (relative)\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  scale_y_reverse()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(\n  gg_fapar,\n  gg_canopydepth,\n  nrow = 1,\n  labels = c(\"a\", \"b\"),\n  rel_widths = c(1, 0.6)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) as a function of LAI (a) and relative light (or photosynthetically active radiation) levels as a function of canopy depth (z) following the Beer-Lambert law. The arrangement of the canopy versus depth (z = 0 at the top of the canopy) is shown by the green rectangle in (b), within which leaves are assumed to be evenly distributed. The yellow line in (b) represents the light levels, relative to the top of the canopy. The brown rectangle represents a stem, indicating that this part is below the canopy - without light-absorbing leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasis of the Beer-Lambert law for canopy light extinction\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Beer-Lambert law model, the light extinction at canopy depth \\(z\\) (measuring from the top) is proportional to the light intensity at that depth and an “optical density” \\(\\mu\\). \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\mu\\;I(z)\n\\tag{4.2}\\] Therefore, the light intensity declines exponentially with \\(z\\). \\[\nI(z) = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu z)\n\\tag{4.3}\\] How does the dependency on \\(z\\) relate to the dependency on LAI (\\(L\\))?\nFor applying the Beer Lambert law, it is further assumed that the canopy is a homogenous turbid medium. In other words, we assume that leaves are uniformly distributed across the canopy and that the optical density is given by the leaf area index \\(L\\) divided by the total canopy depth \\(z_0\\): \\[\n\\mu = k \\frac{L}{z_0}\n\\tag{4.4}\\] \\(k\\) is the leaf area-specific optical density, or light extinction coefficient. Using Equation 4.3 and Equation 4.4, we can thus express the light level at the bottom of the canopy (\\(z_0\\)) as a function of \\(L\\) as \\[\nI(z_0) = I_0 \\; e^{-kL}\n\\] and the fraction of absorbed (photosynthetically active) radiation is \\[\n\\mathrm{fAPAR} = 1 - e^{-kL}\\;.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe radiation \\(I\\) consists of direct radiation from the sun and diffuse radiation from the sky and from radiation scattered within the canopy. This distinction is relevant for understanding radiation absorption by the canopy and canopy-level photosynthesis. Two important implications are the following. First, diffuse radiation is more effectively absorbed by canopies, particularly at low LAI. The reduction of GPP under cloudy conditions is therefore less than what would be expected from considering only changes in \\(I_0\\) (the effective \\(k\\) is higher for diffuse radiation than for direct radiation).\nSecond, the energy flux of direct radiation is much higher than that of diffuse radiation. Although at greater canopy depths, leaves are more frequently exposed to diffuse than to direct radiation, the latter provides potentially valuable energy for photosynthesis, but occurs very rarely (sunflecks). Leaves have to balance the rare high-intensity light levels and the frequent low-intensity levels for adjusting photosynthetic capacities.",

    "section": "4.3 Photosynthesis",
    "text": "4.3 Photosynthesis\nLight use efficiency (LUE, Equation 4.1) measures the efficiency at which absorbed photons (radiation) are converted into C in the form of sugars. LUE is an ecosystem-level quantity and reflects the collective photosynthetic CO2 uptake efficiency of all leaves in the canopy. This efficiency is determined by the leaf physiology and the activity of the photosynthetic machinery. In this subsection, we dive very deep into the physiology of photosynthesis.\nCO2 uptake by the leaf happens by diffusion through pores at the leaf surface (stomata, Figure 4.3). The opening of stomata is dynamically regulated in response to environmental conditions (light, CO2, temperature, atmospheric humidity) and controls the conductance to CO2 diffusion. The CO2 uptake flux by diffusive transport through stomata can thus be described by Fick’s law which states that the flux is proportional to the concentration difference of CO2 inside and outside the leaf. \\[\nA = g_s(c_a - c_i)\n\\tag{4.5}\\] \\(c_a\\) is the ambient CO2 concentration (outside the leaf), and \\(c_i\\) is the CO2 concentration inside the leaf - at the chloroplast. \\(g_s\\) is the stomatal conductance. Note that we use the variable name \\(A\\) here for CO2 assimilation by photosynthesis. In constrast to the ecosystem-level variable GPP, \\(A\\) refers to the leaf-level flux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: CO2 diffuses into the leaf through stomata, while water vapour diffuses out of the leaf. The water vapour diffusion out of the leaves (transpiration) is introduced in Chapter 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce inside the leaf, CO2 diffuses across mesophyll cells to the chloroplasts - the site of photosynthetic reactions. The conductance to this diffusion step - mesophyll conductance - is often ignored for modelling photosynthesis. Reflecting this, we are referring to “leaf-internal” CO2 concentration, \\(c_i\\)” here, instead of a more correct CO2 concentration at the chloroplast.\nPhotosynthesis can be considered as a sequence of three processes that are serially connected - the three processes run one after the other and the rate of the slowest of the three processes determines the overall process rate of photosynthesis. The following is a condensed description, based on Lambers, Chapin, and Pons (2008) and Bonan (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Overview of photosynthesis, distinguishing the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Image taken https://bookdown.org/jcog196013/BS2003/photosynthesis.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Light absorption at the cellular level\nLight (photons) in the photosynthetically active wavelength spectrum (400-700 nm) is absorbed by pigments - mainly chlorophyll. The absorbed energy is transported in the form of excited chlorophyll to the reaction centers of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Relevant for photosynthesis is the number of photons in the photosynthetically active spectrum, not their total energy. That’s why Equation 4.1 is expressed in units of photons, not energy (Watts). (A photon in the blue wavelength has the same effect on CO2 assimilation as a photon in the red wavelength, although it carries a higher energy). The excess energy is dissipated as heat or through other pathways.\n\n\n4.3.2 Light reactions\nIn the reaction centers, the excitation energy of the chlorophyll is used for splitting electrons from water molecules, producing oxygen (O2) as a “side-product”. The electrons are transported along the electron transport chain and are used to produce NADPH and ATP. These are called the light reactions of photosynthesis. Up to here, radiation energy has been converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP. The production of ATP consumes inorganic phosphate.\n\n\n4.3.3 Calvin cycle\nNADPH and ATP are then used for reducing CO2 (the energy-demanding reversal of oxidation) in the Calvin cycle. This step forms C3 compounds (triose-phosphates) and occurs independently of light. It is therefore commonly referred to as the “dark reactions” of photosynthesis. Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is the principal enzyme involved in the Calvin cycle and the amount of Rubisco determines the capacity for the carboxylation of RuBP (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate). Rubisco also catalyzes the oxygenation of RuBP which consumes O2 and produces CO2 as part of photorespiration. This respiration scales with photosynthetic activity and reduces the net photosynthetic CO2 by 30-50%, depending on the relative concentrations of CO2 and O2. At very low CO2 levels, at around 30-50 ppm, the photorespiratory compensation point (\\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\)) is reached and net photosynthesis is zero. In contrast to photorespiration, dark respiration (\\(R_d\\)), which also produces CO2, arises from the decarboxylation of Rubisco and is independent of light, but proportional to the amount of Rubisco.\nReduced C in the form of sucrose or (after an additional step) starch is either consumed in the leaf during the night, or exported through the phloem and used for synthesising biomass or supplying plant-internal C storage as non-structural C (see Chapter 5).\n\n\n4.3.4 Summary\nThe chemical summary equation of photosynthesis is: \\[\nn\\mathrm{CO}_2 + 2n\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow (\\mathrm{CH}_2\\mathrm{O})_n + n\\mathrm{O}_2 + n\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}\n\\tag{4.6}\\] A total of eight photons is consumed to assimilate one molecule of CO2. For each molecule of CO2, one molecule of O2 is produced. And for each molecule of CO2, one molecule of H2O is consumed (net). Note however, that this water consumption is not the primary reason for why plants use water. A much larger amount of water is consumed by the diffusion of water vapour from the water-saturated air inside the leaves out of the stomata. This transpiration flux is further explained in Chapter 7.\n\n\n4.3.5 Response to light and CO2\nThe three steps described above operate in series and each step is potentially rate-limiting and responds differently to the environment. The rates of the processes are coordinated such that they are roughly equal and co-limiting for average environmental conditions to which a leaf is exposed during a day. An imbalance of rates can lead to an excess production of electrons and can cause damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. This happens for example when leaves are exposed to very cold temperatures and high light during a frost event, or when you move your indoor plant that has been sitting in a dark corner for years suddenly into full sunlight outdoors.\nThe response of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (\\(A\\)) to light (PPFD) and leaf-internal CO2 (\\(c_i\\)) reflects the serial nature of how the light and dark reactions are connected. \\(A\\) saturates both in response to increasing PPFD as well as to increasing \\(c_i\\). When a leaf is exposed to increasing PPFD, \\(A\\) initially increases and eventually saturates (Figure 4.5). The slope of the initial linear increase reflects the efficiency at which photons are used for CO2 assimilation in the light reactions (the quantum yield \\(\\varphi_0\\)). Under these conditions, light, i.e. the rate of the light reactions, is limiting, not CO2 inside the leaf. Under conditions of very high light, the dark reactions of the Calvin cycle become limiting. The assimilation rate attained under saturating light is commonly referred to as \\(A_\\mathrm{sat}\\).\nThe level at which the light response of \\(A\\) saturates (\\(A_\\mathrm{sat}\\)) varies within a species and across different plant species. Variations within species arise through the acclimation of the light reaction capacities to the typical light intensities to which a leaf is exposed. Acclimation of photosynthesis evolves over time scales of weeks to months. (Thus, your indoor plant suffers because the change to high-light conditions happened to fast.) \\(A_\\mathrm{sat}\\) also varies across species, reflecting the adaptation through evolution of different plant species to the environment in which they commonly grow. A typical light adaptation to different light levels is expressed by plants that commonly grow in the shady understorey versus plants that grow in the sun-exposed upper canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Response of leaf photosynthesis to light and how it varies within species through acclimation to different growth environments (A) and across species through evolutionary adaptation (B). Figure from Lambers, Chapin, and Pons (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, the response of \\(A\\) to \\(c_i\\) initially increase and saturates at high \\(c_i\\). This is reflected by the so-called “A-ci curve” (Figure 4.6). Commonly, net assimilation \\(A_n = A - R_d\\) is considered when analysing A-ci curves. \\(A_n\\) is initially negative until the photorespiratory compensation point (\\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\)) is reached. Then, \\(A_n\\) increases steeply with \\(c_i\\) as it is limited by the rate of RuBP carboxylation by Rubisco. This Rubisco carboxylation-limited functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted \\(A_C\\).\nAs \\(c_i\\) increases further, \\(A\\) is no longer limited by RuBP carboxylation, but by the rate at which RuBP becomes available. This, in turn, is governed by the rate at which ATP and NADPH are produced and thus by the rate of electron transport \\(J\\). This functional response of assimilation is commonly denoted \\(A_J\\). A limiting electron transport rate may be due to limiting light or a limiting capacity of electron transport (\\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\)). A slower further increase of \\(A\\) with \\(c_i\\) in the electron transport-limited range is due to the suppression of RuBP oxygenation at high concentrations of CO2 (relative to O2). The effective assimilation rate across the full range of \\(c_i\\) is the minimum of the electron transport-limited and the RuBP carboxylation-limited rate: \\[\nA_n = \\min(A_C, A_J) - R_d\n\\tag{4.7}\\]\nThe A-ci curve (Figure 4.6) can be measured in the field and reveals the rates and efficiencies of the individual processes of the photosynthesis “chain” (light and dark reactions). These quantities are key for quantitatively describing and modeling leaf photosynthesis (see Box Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: The A-ci curve. Net assimilation (An = A - Rd) is measured for different levels of leaf-internal CO2 concentrations (black dots). The functional forms of AC and AJ are fitted to the data points. The grey point indicates the co-limitation point.

It depends on the partial pressure of oxygen (\\(p\\mathrm{O}_2\\)). \\[\nK = K_c \\left(1 + \\frac{p\\mathrm{O}_2}{K_o} \\right)\n\\] \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\), \\(K_c\\), \\(K_o\\), and \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\) all have a temperature dependency. In addition, \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\) is proportional to atmospheric pressure. These dependencies are shown in Section 4.3.6 and are described in full detail in Stocker et al. (2020).\nThe electron transport-limited assimilation rate \\(A_J\\) can be described as \\[\nA_J = \\frac{J}{4} \\cdot \\frac{c_i - \\Gamma^\\ast}{c_i + 2 \\Gamma^\\ast}\\;.\n\\tag{4.9}\\] The electron transport rate \\(J\\) is described by a saturating function that increases with absorbed light \\(I_\\mathrm{abs}\\) up to a maximum rate \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\) \\[\nJ = \\frac{4\\varphi_0 I_\\mathrm{abs}}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{4\\varphi_0 I_\\mathrm{abs}}{J_\\mathrm{max}}\\right)^2}}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nTogether, Equation 4.8 and Equation 4.9 describe the combined effect of \\(c_i\\), (leaf) temperature, the absorbed photon flux density, and atmospheric pressure on leaf-level CO2 assimilation.\nWith the mathematical description of \\(A_C\\) and \\(A_J\\) and their dependency on light and CO2 following the FvCB model, A-ci and the A vs. PPFD curves, as shown for measurements in Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6, can thereby be modeled.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rpmodel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# modified seq() function to get a logarithmically spaced sequence\nlseq &lt;- function(from=1, to=100000, length.out=6) {\n  exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length.out = length.out))\n}\n\n# Set model parameters (constants)\n# see Stocker et al., 2020 GMD for a description\nbeta &lt;- 146          # unit cost ratio a/b\nc_cost &lt;- 0.41       # marginal cost of Jmax\ngamma &lt;- 0.105       # unit cost ratio c/b\nkphio &lt;- 0.085       # quantum yield efficiency\nc_molmass &lt;- 12.0107 # molar mass, g / mol\n\n# Define environmental conditions\ntc &lt;- 15             # temperature, deg C\nppfd &lt;- 500          # micro-mol/m2/s\nvpd  &lt;- 300          # Pa\nco2  &lt;- 400          # ppm\nelv  &lt;- 0            # m.a.s.l.\nfapar &lt;- 1           # fraction\npatm &lt;- 101325       # Pa\n\n# get photosynthesis parameters gammastar, vcmax, jmax from p-model\n# this assumes vcmax and jmax to be optimally acclimated/adapted to\n# the specified environmental conditions and considers the temperature\n# and atmospheric-pressure dependence of all parameters.\nout_pmodel &lt;- rpmodel(\n  tc             = tc,\n  vpd            = vpd,\n  co2            = co2,\n  elv            = elv,\n  kphio          = kphio,\n  beta           = beta,\n  fapar          = fapar,\n  ppfd           = ppfd,\n  method_optci   = \"prentice14\",\n  method_jmaxlim = \"wang17\",\n  do_ftemp_kphio = FALSE\n  )\n\n# electron transport-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_aj &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kphio, ppfd, jmax){\n  kphio * ppfd * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + 2 * gammastar) * 1/sqrt(1+((4 * kphio * ppfd)/jmax)^2)\n}\n\n# RuBP carboxylation-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_ac &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kmm, vcmax){\n  vcmax * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + kmm)\n}\n\n# assimilation rate given stomatal conductance and leaf-internal \n# CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_a_gs &lt;- function(ci, gs, ca){\n  gs * (ca - ci)\n}\n\n# conversion of CO2 concentration in ppm to partial pressure in Pa\nco2_to_ca &lt;- function( co2, patm ){\n  ( 1.0e-6 ) * co2 * patm\n}\n\ndf_ci &lt;- tibble(\n  ci = seq(0, 1000, length.out = 100)) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(ci_pa = co2_to_ca(ci, patm = patm)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_j = calc_aj(ci_pa, \n                       out_pmodel$gammastar, \n                       kphio = kphio, \n                       ppfd = ppfd, \n                       jmax = out_pmodel$jmax)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_c = calc_ac(ci_pa, \n                       out_pmodel$gammastar, \n                       out_pmodel$kmm, \n                       vcmax = out_pmodel$vcmax)) |&gt;\n  mutate(a_act = min(a_j, a_c)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_gs = calc_a_gs(ci_pa, \n                          gs = out_pmodel$gs, \n                          ca = out_pmodel$ca))\n  \ndf_ci |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\n    a_j, \n    a_c\n    # a_gs\n    ), \n    names_to = \"Rate\", \n    values_to = \"a_\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = ci)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = a_, color = Rate)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = a_act)) +\n  xlim(00, 1000) + \n  # ylim(-20, 80) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = (out_pmodel$gammastar/(1.0e-6 * patm)), linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(italic(\"c\")[i], \" (ppm)\")), \n       y = expression(paste(italic(\"A\"), \" (\", mu, \"mol m\" ^{-2},\" s\" ^{-1}, \")\"))) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"\",\n    breaks = c(\n      # \"a_gs\",\n      \"a_j\",\n      \"a_c\"\n      ),\n    labels = c(\n      # expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[gs])),\n      expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[J])),\n      expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[C]))\n      ),\n    values = c( \n      # \"#009E73\", \n      \"#56B4E9\", \n      \"#E69F00\"\n      )) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: The A-ci curve as simulated by the FvCB model. Ags is shown here as the dependency of A on stomatal conductance following Equation 4.5 for a given gs. The fact that AC, AJ, and Ags intersect in one point does not follow from the FvCB model, but is simulated here based on a model of eco-evolutionary optimality (P-model Stocker et al. (2020), implemented by the {rpmodel} R package) which predicts that photosynthetic capacities are acclimated such that a leaf operates close to the intersection point of AC and and AJ. The point at which curves intersect with the x-axis (y = 0) is the photorespiratory compensation point. The environmental conditions used as forcing for the simulation displayed here can be seen by unfolding code.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8 shows the light response curve of \\(A_J - R_d\\) following the FvCB model. The response is shown for leaves acclimated to different levels of light, thus having different values for \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\). Because acclimation to light also involves a change in the Rubisco content of leaves and thus \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\), “high-light leaves” also have higher dark respiration rates. Therefore, under low light conditions, leaves acclimated to low light have higher net assimilation rates than leaves acclimated to high light. This is illustrated by Figure 4.8 a.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rpmodel)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# modified seq() function to get a logarithmically spaced sequence\nlseq &lt;- function(from=1, to=100000, length.out=6) {\n  exp(seq(log(from), log(to), length.out = length.out))\n}\n\n# Set model parameters (constants)\n# see Stocker et al., 2020 GMD for a description\nbeta &lt;- 146          # unit cost ratio a/b\nc_cost &lt;- 0.41       # marginal cost of Jmax\ngamma &lt;- 0.105       # unit cost ratio c/b\nkphio &lt;- 0.085       # quantum yield efficiency\nc_molmass &lt;- 12.0107 # molar mass, g / mol\n\n# Define environmental conditions\ntc &lt;- 15             # temperature, deg C\nppfd &lt;- 500          # micro-mol/m2/s\nvpd  &lt;- 300          # Pa\nco2  &lt;- 400          # ppm\nelv  &lt;- 0            # m.a.s.l.\nfapar &lt;- 1           # fraction\npatm &lt;- 101325       # Pa\n\n# get photosynthesis parameters gammastar, vcmax, jmax from p-model\n# this assumes vcmax and jmax to be optimally acclimated/adapted to\n# the specified environmental conditions and considers the temperature\n# and atmospheric-pressure dependence of all parameters.\n\n# first for low light\nout_pmodel_lo &lt;- rpmodel(\n  tc             = tc,\n  vpd            = vpd,\n  co2            = co2,\n  elv            = elv,\n  kphio          = kphio,\n  beta           = beta,\n  fapar          = fapar,\n  ppfd           = ppfd*0.5,\n  method_optci   = \"prentice14\",\n  method_jmaxlim = \"wang17\",\n  do_ftemp_kphio = FALSE\n  )\n\n# medium light\nout_pmodel_me &lt;- rpmodel(\n  tc             = tc,\n  vpd            = vpd,\n  co2            = co2,\n  elv            = elv,\n  kphio          = kphio,\n  beta           = beta,\n  fapar          = fapar,\n  ppfd           = ppfd,\n  method_optci   = \"prentice14\",\n  method_jmaxlim = \"wang17\",\n  do_ftemp_kphio = FALSE\n  )\n\n# high light\nout_pmodel_hi &lt;- rpmodel(\n  tc             = tc,\n  vpd            = vpd,\n  co2            = co2,\n  elv            = elv,\n  kphio          = kphio,\n  beta           = beta,\n  fapar          = fapar,\n  ppfd           = ppfd*2,\n  method_optci   = \"prentice14\",\n  method_jmaxlim = \"wang17\",\n  do_ftemp_kphio = FALSE\n  )\n\n# electron transport-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_aj &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kphio, ppfd, jmax){\n  kphio * ppfd * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + 2 * gammastar) * 1/sqrt(1+((4 * kphio * ppfd)/jmax)^2)\n}\n\n# RuBP carboxylation-limited assimilation rate as a function of CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_ac &lt;- function(ci, gammastar, kmm, vcmax){\n  vcmax * (ci - gammastar)/(ci + kmm)\n}\n\n# assimilation rate given stomatal conductance and leaf-internal \n# CO2 partial pressure\ncalc_a_gs &lt;- function(ci, gs, ca){\n  gs * (ca - ci)\n}\n\n# conversion of CO2 concentration in ppm to partial pressure in Pa\nco2_to_ca &lt;- function( co2, patm ){\n  ( 1.0e-6 ) * co2 * patm\n}\n\ndf_ppfd &lt;- tibble(\n  ppfd = seq(0, 2000, length.out = 100)) |&gt;

The environmental conditions used as forcing for the simulation displayed here can be seen by unfolding code.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the FvCB model, on its own, does not allow us to model the LUE term in Equation 4.1. An important additional ingredient is the stomatal conductance (\\(g_s\\)) which is relevant for determining the ratio of ambient to leaf-internal CO2 concentrations. It is described in Section 4.4.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Response to temperature\nAll processes involved in photosynthesis are strongly affected by temperature. Enzymatic rates, like Rubisco carboxylation, have a temperature at which reaction rates have a maximum. As a consequence, assimilation rates also attain a maximum at a certain temperature - the temperature optimum (Topt). In contrast, dark respiration (\\(R_d\\)) monotonically increases with temperature. That is, it continues to rise as temperatures go up - without attaining a maximum. As a consequence, the decline of net assimilation rates is even faster at towards high temperatures than that of gross assimilation rates.\nThe temperature dependency of leaf CO2 assimilation rates can be measured in the field by exposing a leaf to a range of temperatures (within a relatively short period of time) and measuring assimilation rates for each temperature. When looking at such measurements, a temperature optimum of net photosynthesis is evident.\nThe Farquhar-von Caemmerer Berry model for C3 photosynthesis (see Box ‘Farquhar von Caemmerer Berry model’) and the mathematical description of temperature dependencies of factors therein (\\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\), \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\), \\(K_c\\), \\(K_o\\), and \\(\\Gamma^\\ast\\), temperature dependencies not shown here) provide a basis for modelling the temperature dependency of assimilation rates. Such modelled temperature dependencies are shown in Figure 4.9.\n\n\nCode\ndf_temp &lt;- tibble(\n  temp = seq(0, 40, length.out = 100)) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(gammastar = gammastar(temp, patm = 101325),\n         kmm = kmm(temp, patm = 101325),\n         vcmax = out_pmodel$vcmax25 * ftemp_inst_vcmax(temp, tcgrowth = 15),\n         jmax = 1.7 * out_pmodel$vcmax25 * ftemp_inst_jmax(temp, tcgrowth = 15),\n         rd = 0.05 * out_pmodel$vcmax25 * ftemp_inst_rd(temp)\n         ) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_j = calc_aj(ci = 28.14209, \n                       gammastar, \n                       kphio = kphio, \n                       ppfd = ppfd, \n                       jmax = jmax)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_c = calc_ac(ci = 28.14209, \n                       gammastar, \n                       kmm, \n                       vcmax = vcmax)) |&gt; \n  mutate(a_cr = a_c - rd, \n         a_jr = a_j - rd) |&gt; \n  mutate(assim = min(a_jr, a_cr))\n\ngg1 &lt;- df_temp |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(gammastar, kmm), \n               names_to = \"Rate\", \n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = temp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = value, color = Rate)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Temperature (°C)\")), \n       y = expression(paste(\"Value (Pa)\"))) +\n  khroma::scale_color_okabeito(\n    name = \"\", \n    breaks = c(\"gammastar\", \n               \"kmm\"),\n    labels = c(expression(paste(italic(Gamma)^\"*\")), \n               expression(italic(K)))\n    ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\ngg2 &lt;- df_temp |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(vcmax, jmax, rd), \n               names_to = \"Rate\", \n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = temp)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = value, color = Rate)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Temperature (°C)\")), \n       y = expression(paste(\"Rate (\", mu, \"mol m\" ^{-2},\" s\" ^{-1}, \")\"))) +\n  khroma::scale_color_okabeito(\n    name = \"\", \n    breaks = c(\"vcmax\", \n               \"jmax\", \n               \"rd\"),\n    labels = c(expression(paste(italic(\"V\")[cmax])), \n               expression(paste(italic(\"J\")[max])), \n               expression(paste(italic(\"R\")[d])))\n    ) +\n  theme_classic()\n\ndf_net_plot &lt;- df_temp |&gt; \n  mutate(a_cr = a_c - rd,\n         a_jr = a_j - rd) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(rd, a_cr, a_jr, assim), \n               names_to = \"Rate\", \n               values_to = \"value\")\n\ndf_gross_plot &lt;- df_temp |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(a_c, a_j), \n               names_to = \"Rate\", \n               values_to = \"value\")\n\ngg3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = temp, y = value, color = Rate),\n            data = df_gross_plot,\n            linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_line(aes(x = temp, y = value, color = Rate),\n            data = df_net_plot) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"\",\n    breaks = c(\"rd\",\n               \"a_c\",\n               \"a_j\",\n               \"a_cr\",\n               \"a_jr\",\n               \"assim\"\n               ),\n    labels = c(expression(paste(italic(\"R\")[d])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[C])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[J])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[C] ~ - ~ italic(\"R\")[d])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[J] ~ - ~ italic(\"R\")[d])),\n               expression(paste(italic(\"A\")[n]))),\n    values = c(\"#CC79A7\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"black\")\n  ) +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Temperature (°C)\")), \n       y = expression(paste(italic(\"A\"), \"(\", mu, \"mol m\" ^{-2},\" s\" ^{-1}, \")\")),\n       color = \"Rate\",\n       linetype = \"Rate\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(gg1, gg2, gg3, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Temperature dependencies of quantities in the FvCB model.

That is, they represent the responses to changes in temperature that evolve over short time scales - minutes to hours. Over longer time scales, the shapes of the instantaneous temperature responses change. The temperature optimum of photosynthesis (Topt) tends to be higher for plant species that grow in warm climates than for plants that can be found in cold climates (Figure 4.10 a). Such variations of Topt across different plant species reflects species’ adaptation to their growth environment which makes them perform well and compete effectively under certain environmental conditions and is related to their genes and is thus passed on from generation to generation. Topt can be considered as a plant trait (see Section 2.4).\nTopt not only varies between species growing in different climates, but can also vary within a given species and even within a given plant when it is exposed to different temperatures for a longer period (Kumarathunge et al. 2019). Given enough time, the instantaneous temperature response and Topt will shift to higher temperatures as a result of persistent exposure to warmer temperatures. Such variations in a plant trait (here Topt) within species and an individual plant is referred to as acclimation. Figure 4.10 b shows how Topt varies within different species (distinguished by color) over the course of the seasons - a demonstration of acclimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Temperature optimum of leaf net photosynthesis at an intercellular CO2 concentration of 275 micro-mol mol-1 (ToptA275) of mature plants growing in their native environments (d), species in the field (grown at ambient growth temperatures) measured in at least two or more seasons (e). Tgrowth is the mean air temperature of the preceding 30 d. Different colours depict plant functional types: orange, tropical evergreen angiosperms (EA-Tr); light blue, arctic tundra; red, temperate deciduous angiosperms (DA-Te); blue, temperate evergreen angiosperms (EA-Te); green, boreal evergreen gymnosperms (EG-Br); purple, temperate evergreen gymnosperms (EG-Te); those in (b,c,e,f) depict different datasets. The thick black lines are: (in d) least-squares linear regression fits and linear mixed-effect model fits (in e) with random intercepts for each dataset. Error bars represent +/-1 standard error. Figure and caption text from Kumarathunge et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nAcclimation is relatively common to observe also for other physiological traits than Topt. For example, photosynthetic capacities (the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation - \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\) in the FvCB model - or the maximum rate of electron transport - \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\)) acclimate over the course of seasons (Jiang et al. 2020). Other plant traits are less plastic or not plastic at all. For example phenological strategies (e.g., deciduousness) does not acclimate. The acclimation of physiological traits is important for understanding vegetation and land carbon cycle responses to long-term trends in climate. While it may be exected that plants have a certain capacity for acclimation to a new climate, limits to acclimation must be better understood.\n\n\n\n4.3.8 C4 photosynthesis\nComing soon.",

    "text": "4.4 Transpiration and leaf water-carbon coupling\nThe opening of stomata is highly sensitive to environmental factors and the CO2 assimilation rate feeds back to stomatal opening. By opening and closing stomata, plants regulate the conductance to CO2 diffusion from the ambient air into the leaves and to the photosynthesis reaction sites. Simultaneously, when stomata are open, water vapour diffuses out of the leaf - transpiration. This link between CO2 and water loss is at the core of stomatal regulation to balance C uptake and desiccation.\nThe diffusive supply of CO2 to the photosynthetic reaction sites is determined by a series of conductances. The description of the diffusive CO2 uptake in Equation 4.5 resolves this as a single conductance. However, stomatal conductance is only one chain in this series. More realistically, the leaf boundary layer conductance and the mesophyll conductance are treated separately from the stomatal conductance. However, because the leaf boundary layer conductance is much larger than the stomatal conductance, it is not limiting. Furthermore, actively regulated plant physiological responses to the environment arise through the stomatal conductance \\(g_s\\). As described in Section 4.3, mesophyll conductance is often ignored due to practical limitations for separating it from stomatal conductance in measurements and due to very poorly known dependencies to the environment. Hence, we focus on \\(g_s\\) here and describe the diffusive CO2 supply to photosynthesis by Equation 4.5.\nThe diffusive water vapour flux out of the leaf - transpiration - is driven by the difference of water vapour pressure in the leaf-interior air spaces (\\(e_i\\)) and the the water vapour pressure at the leaf surface (\\(e_s\\)). Their difference is commonly referred to as the vapour pressure deficit (VPD), here denoted as \\(D = e_s - e_i\\). Leaf-interior air spaces are water vapour-saturated, while the surrounding air is not. Fick’s law predicts that a diffusive flux occurs in presence of a concentration difference, hence transpiration can be described as \\[\nE = 1.6 \\; g_s \\; D\n\\tag{4.11}\\] The factor 1.6 arises due to the lower diffusivity of CO2 compared with H2O. Hence, \\(g_s\\) has to be understood as a conductance to CO2 diffusion (mol CO2 m-2 s-1). Note that \\(g_s\\) regulates both transpiration (Equation 4.11) and assimilation (Equation 4.5) at the leaf-level. A tight coupling between water and carbon fluxes at the leaf-level follows from the physical principle of diffusion.\nWater loss through transpiration poses risks and incurs costs for a plant. The diffusive water vapour flux through stomata has to be maintained by root water uptake from the soil and transport along the xylem in the plant. When the water content in the rooting zone declines, it becomes increasingly hard for plants to extract water from the soil - they have to “suck” out the water with a increasingly negative water potential - a negative pressure. The hydraulic relationships of water transport along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum will be introduced later. What matters here is that such negative water potentials along the water transport pathway are dangerous for the plant and can lead to lethal desiccation of cells, leaves, branches, or entire plants.\nAvoidance of dangerous desiccation is enabled by responses at the level of leaves and the plant which operate at a range of time scales. At time scales of seconds to minutes and at the level of a leaf, stomatal conductance is reduced in response to dry air and dry soil conditions. At time scales of weeks to months, or even years, the the leaf area of a plant may decline under dry conditions. At even longer time scales (albeit this time scale is subject to large unknowns and active research), plants are genetically adapted (or may acclimate within their lifetime) to dry conditions by resistant water transport (resistant xylem) and effective water uptake organs (deeper roots).\nObviously, such adaptations and the largely instantaneous stomatal response incurs a cost - the opportunity cost of reduced CO2 assimilation when stomatal conductance is reduced and the construction cost of building water-stress adapted organs. Hence, plants always have to balance carbon uptake and water loss and a tight carbon-water coupling at the level of plants, and ecosystems arises from these leaf-level processes.\n\n4.4.1 Water use efficiency\nThe trade-off between transpiration and assimilation can be measured by considering their ratio by combining Equation 4.5 and Equation 4.11 to define the instantaneous water-use efficiency: \\[\n\\frac{A_n}{E} = \\frac{c_a(1 - \\chi)}{1.6\\;D}\\;,\n\\tag{4.12}\\] where \\(\\chi = c_i/c_a\\). The instantaneous water-use efficiency is proportional to \\(D^{-1}\\). In other words, the drier the air, the more transpiration per unit net CO2 assimilation a leaf “suffers”. This demonstrates the strong effect of atmospheric dryness on the water-carbon trade-off. To remove the effect of vapour pressure deficit (\\(D\\)) on transpiration and focus on the biological component of the water-carbon trade-off, the intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) is defined by relating net assimilation to stomatal conductance: \\[\n\\frac{A_n}{g_s} = \\frac{c_a}{1.6}(1 - \\chi)\n\\tag{4.13}\\] Note that Equation 4.12 and Equation 4.13 are written as being proportional to \\(c_a(1-\\chi)\\). Of course, this term is mathematically equivalent to \\((c_a - c_i)\\). However, there is a reason for expressing it this way. First, it reflects the direct influence of \\(c_a\\) ambient (atmospheric) CO2 concentration on the water-carbon trade-off - less water is lost for a given amount of C assimilation under elevated CO2. Second, observations suggest that \\(\\chi\\) is regulated by plants to remain relatively constant under a wide range of CO2 levels (Ainsworth and Long 2005) and Figure 4.11. The near constancy of \\(\\chi\\) is also reflected by the observation that \\(A_n\\) and \\(g_s\\) vary in near proportion across a wide range of light levels (Bonan 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Constancy of leaf-internal to ambient CO2. (a) Relationship between net photosynthesis (An) and stomatal conductance (gs) of one species (Jack pine) over a range of light conditions. A linear relationship is reflective of a constant ci:ca.

Figure from Ainsworth and Long (2005). ci:ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Isotopic fractionation\nComing soon.\n\n\n4.4.3 Stomatal regulation\nThe closing of stomates and the reduction of stomatal conductance \\(g_s\\) under dry conditions prevents plants from dangerous desiccation. However, a reduced \\(g_s\\) also leads to a reduction in CO2 diffusion into leaves and thus a reduction of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. Hence, plants have to balance a trade-off between carbon gain and the risk of desiccation. A complete stomatal closure under moderately dry conditions (low soil moisture, high VPD) may be safe in terms of desiccation avoidance but comes at an excessive cost in terms of foregone CO2 uptake (and similarly vice-versa). An optimal strategy must lie somewhere in between these extreme strategies.\nObservations of leaf and ecosystem fluxes CO2 and water vapour fluxes document how stomatal conductance responds to increasing VPD and decreasing soil moisture. Figure 4.12 shows this for measurements taken at the ecosystem-level, quantifying the canopy stomatal conductance (denoted by an uppercase \\(G_s\\)), representative for the collective behaviour of all leaves in the canopy. Three important aspects of this relationship stand out. First, \\(G_s\\) declines in response to VPD in a non-linear fashion (high sensitivity to VPD at low VPD, lower sensitivity towards higher VPD). Second, there is an interaction between the effect of VPD and soil moisture. Under conditions of dry soils, \\(G_s\\) is reduced compared to wet soils, given the same VPD. Third, at the most moist site (Figure 4.12 a), \\(G_s\\) under moist conditions (moist soils, low VPD) is highest but declines most rapidly with VPD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Response of canopy conductance (ecosystem-level aggregate stomatal conductance) to soil and air drying at four different sites (a-d) that differ in average aridity. Soil moisture levels are represented by colors of circles. DI in each panel’s title is the site’s dryness index calculated as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration over precipitation. Figure from Novick et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple empirical model for the \\(G_s\\) response to VPD (Oren et al. 2001) is given by \\[\nG_s = G_{s,\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(1 - m \\ln D \\right)\\;.\n\\] Here, \\(G_{s,\\mathrm{ref}}\\) is a reference canopy conductance, \\(D\\) is VPD, and \\(m\\) is a stomatal sensitivity parameter. The data shown in Figure 4.12 indicate that the sensitivity parameter \\(m\\) is not a constant, but decreases with drying soils and tends to be lower at dry sites than at moist sites investigated by Novick et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStomatal optimization models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aspect that plants regulate stomatal conductance to balance the trade-off between carbon gain and water loss lends itself to modelling the stomatal response considering optimality principles. Indeed, there is empirical evidence that optimality models are a good representation of how stomata are regulated. Following this notion, it can be assumed that stomatal conductance is optimised such that the net between the carbon gain by increasing stomatal conductance and the carbon cost by the resulting increased transpiration and is maximized.\n\\[\nA - aE - bV_\\mathrm{cmax} = \\arg \\max\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nOver time scales of days to weeks, \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\) in the FvCB model (see box above) is coordinated with stomatal conductance (Joshi et al. 2022). The simultaneous effects of \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\) and \\(g_s\\) are reflected by \\(\\chi\\). Therefore, Equation 4.14 can be expressed with respect to optimising \\(\\chi\\). Maximising a function is equivalent to finding the point where its first derivative (here with respect to \\(\\chi\\)) is zero. (Prentice et al. 2014) formulated such a similar (but not strictly equivalent) optimality criterion as \\[\n\\frac{\\partial (E/A)}{\\partial \\chi} + \\beta \\frac{\\partial (V_\\mathrm{cmax}/A)}{\\partial \\chi} = 0 \\;.\n\\] \\(E/A\\) is the unit cost of transpiration. \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}/A\\) is the unit cost of carboxylation. Their sum is minimized here with respect to \\(\\chi\\). \\(\\beta\\) is the unit cost ratio. From this, the response of the stomatal conductance to \\(D\\) and \\(A\\) can be derived (not shown here, but in Stocker et al. (2020)) as \\[\ng_s = \\left( 1 + \\frac{g_1}{\\sqrt{D}} \\right) \\frac{A}{c_a - \\Gamma^\\ast}\n\\] \\(g_1\\) is a stomatal sensitivity parameter. Similar results are obtained with a related but not identical optimality criterion (Medlyn et al. 2011).",

    "text": "4.5 From photosynthesis to light use efficiency\nThe light use efficiency model (Equation 4.1) and the FvCB model (Equation 4.9 and Equation 4.10) represent a contrasting response of photosynthesis to light - linear in Equation 4.1 and saturating (by effects of a finite \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\)) in Equation 4.9 and Equation 4.10. It should be noted that the LUE model describes the photosynthetic CO2 uptake at the canopy-level and for periods of multiple days to weeks (total GPP vs. total absorbed light). In contrast, the FvCB model describes the light-photosynthesis relationship at the leaf-level and in response to rapid changes in light (e.g., over the course of a day).\nAs pointed out in Section 4.3.5, plants tend to coordinate the light and carboxylation-limited assimilation rates flexibly in response to average environmental conditions to which they are exposed while performing photosynthesis. Tending towards the co-limitation point can also be understood as an optimal functioning - avoiding overinvestment into maintaining a high maximum electron transport rate (\\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\)) while being carboxylation-limited (too low \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\)), or the opposite. In other words, the higher the average light levels, the higher the maximum carboxylation capacity and therefore the amount of Rubisco in leaves. The linear relationship between GPP and PPFD in Equation 4.1 can be interpreted as an emerging relationship from the coordination of \\(A_C\\) and \\(A_J\\), and thus of \\(V_\\mathrm{cmax}\\) and \\(J_\\mathrm{max}\\).\nA very simple model, by which LUE is assumed to be constant over time and across ecosystems and using Equation 4.1 explains about 80% of observed GPP variations in data obtained from ecosystem flux measurements, as shown in Figure 4.13.

C is respired by plants (autotrophic respiration) and by soil microbes (heterotrophic respiration). C in live vegetation biomass is turned over to produce litter (litterfall) as trees shed their leaves and lose branches (over years) and as they die (over decades to centuries). Plant mortality is related to the size and age of a tree and may be driven by disturbances (fire, pests, extreme drought and heat). Within years, litter is respired or transformed into soil organic C where it may be stabilized for centuries and more. Heterotrophic respiration originates from litter and soil C decomposition by microbes (fungi and bacteria).\nFigure 5.1: An illustrative (a) and schematic (b) representation of arbon fluxes and pools in land ecosystems.

    "text": "5.1.1 Non-structural carbon and autotrophic respiration\nC assimilated by photosynthesis is initially present as non-structural C (NSC) in the form of hydrocarbons (sugars). Some of the assimilated C is stored internally in the form of starch to fuel the reserves pool. Some of the assimilated carbon is consumed by autotrophic respiration (\\(R_a\\)) which subsumes different processes, including maintaining vital functions of the plant (maintenance respiration), inevitable losses during photosynthesis (leaf dark respiration, \\(R_d\\), see Section 4.3.5), and energetic costs for biomass synthesis (growth respiration, \\(R_g\\)). Growth respiration produces CO2 as new biomass is formed, scales with the rate of new biomass formation (BP, see below), and is typically taken to be independent of temperature in vegetation models. Symbols used in this chapter are listed in Table 5.2.\nMaintenance respiration depends on plant size and temperature. It is commonly modelled as being proportional to the pool size of live biomass (sapwood, fine roots). Hence, the respiratory costs is higher for larger plants than for small plants. In vegetation models, \\(R_a\\) is often assumed to depend on the C:N ratio (mass ratio of C to nitrogen in biomass), with lower C:N ratios associated with higher respiration rates. Temperature drives a strong instantaneous response in \\(R_a\\), but respiration rates acclimate to average growth temperatures such that the relationship between \\(R_a\\) and temperature is less steep when considering longer time scales or variations across different climates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature dependency of respiration\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical temperature dependency of respiration, used in the LPJ vegetation model (Lloyd and Taylor 1994; Sitch et al. 2003), is given by Equation 5.1 and visualised in Figure 5.2. \\[\n\\begin{align}\nR_{m,i} &= r_i C_i f(T) \\\\\nf(T)    &= \\exp \\left( E_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{56.02} - \\frac{1}{T+46.02} \\right) \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.1}\\] \\(r_i\\) is a specific respiration rate for a given plant compartment \\(i\\) and at standard temperature, typically taken to be 10°C. \\(C_i\\) is the biomass C pool size and \\(f(T)\\) is a factor that accounts for the temperature dependency of maintenance respiration. \\(E_0\\) is an activation energy, set to 308.56 J.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ncalc_ft_arrhenius &lt;- function(temp){\n  exp(308.56 * (1/56.02 - 1/(temp + 46.02)))\n}\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_function(fun = calc_ft_arrhenius) +\n  xlim(0, 35) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  labs(x = \"Temperature (°C)\",\n       y = expression(paste(\"Respiration factor \", italic(f), \"(\", italic(T), \")\"))) + \n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Temperature dependency of maintenance respiration, modelled based on a modified Arrhenius equation (Lloyd and Taylor 1994; Sitch et al. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Net primary productivity\nAt the plant-level, C used for growth is supplied by NSC. The availability of NSC for growth depends on the balance of C assimilation and autotrophic respiration, is influenced by abiotic conditions (temperature, plant desiccation), and varies over the seasons. For example, when leaves are flushed in deciduous plants, the required C is drawn from the NSC pool. Wood is produced not evenly over the seasons, but in a limited period during the growing season which varies strongly between species. Grasses switch from a vegetative growth phase, producing leaves, in the early season to a seed-producing phase later.\nThe amount of C invested into growth of new biomass in leaves (\\(\\Delta C_\\mathrm{leaves}\\)), fine roots (\\(\\Delta C_\\mathrm{roots}\\)), and wood (\\(\\Delta C_\\mathrm{wood}\\)) plus the production organic compounds released through leaves (volatile organic compounds, \\(C_\\mathrm{VOC}\\)) and roots (exudates, \\(C_\\mathrm{exu}\\)), plus the change in NSC storage (\\(\\Delta C_\\mathrm{NSC}\\)) is equal to the gross primary productivity (GPP) minus autotrophic respiration (\\(R_a\\)). This is the definition of the ecosystem-level vegetation C mass balance. The sum of biomass production in different plant compartments plus \\((C_\\mathrm{VOC} + C_\\mathrm{exu})\\) is referred to as the net primary productivity (NPP) and is commonly expressed for annual total fluxes. Over longer (\\(\\sim\\)annual) time scales, the change in NSC storage can be neglected \\((\\Delta C_\\mathrm{NSC} = 0)\\) and the following applies: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{NPP} &= \\mathrm{GPP} - R_a \\\\\n             &= \\Delta C_\\mathrm{leaves} + \\Delta C_\\mathrm{roots} + \\Delta C_\\mathrm{wood} + C_\\mathrm{VOC} + C_\\mathrm{exu}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.2}\\] These two terms \\(C_\\mathrm{VOC}\\) and \\(C_\\mathrm{exu}\\) are difficult to measure in the field and tend to be smaller than the other terms. Therefore, the biomass productivity is more commonly quantified from observations. \\[\n\\mathrm{BP} = \\Delta C_\\mathrm{leaves} + \\Delta C_\\mathrm{roots} + \\Delta C_\\mathrm{wood}\n\\tag{5.3}\\] Note that there is often some ambiguity in definitions of in the literature and ‘NPP’ is used instead of ‘BP’. BP is expressed as a flux of C per unit square meter (for example gC m-2 yr-1). It measures the amount of biomass C produced per unit ground area and time. NPP is expressed in the same units and additionally includes C produced and released as volatie organic compounds and exudates. These do not contribute to biomass of the plant itself and are relatively short-lived. However, they are not in the form of oxidized C (as is \\(R_a\\)) and therefore are counted towards NPP.\nThe ratio of NPP:GPP is commonly referred to as the ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUE), and BP:GPP as the biomass production efficiency (BPE).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{CUE} &= \\mathrm{NPP} / \\mathrm{GPP} \\\\\n\\mathrm{BPE} &= \\mathrm{BP} / \\mathrm{GPP} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\nAs shown in Figure 5.3, BP is linearly related to GPP across ecosystems, indicating that BP can be assumed to be a constant fraction of GPP - albeit with substantial uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: BP and BPE. (a) relationship of biomass productivity (BP) versus gross primary productivity (GPP) across 231 sites. (b) Distribution of the biomass production efficiency (BPE) across 231 sites. Data from Peng et al. (n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a typical magnitude of \\(R_a\\), expressed as a fraction of GPP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Allocation and growth\nThe partitioning of available NSC to growth in different plant compartments, to VOC, exudates, or respiration is referred to as allocation. Quantitatively, allocation to a given compartment can be expressed as the ratio of BP of that compartment (leaves, roots, wood) over the total NPP. \\[\n\\alpha_i = \\Delta C_i / \\mathrm{NPP}\n\\tag{5.5}\\] Since C allocated to exudates and volatile organic compounds are rarely measured, BP is commonly used instead of NPP in Equation 5.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Allocation. (a) Relationship of leaf biomass production vs. total biomass production. (b) Distribution of the fractional allocation to leaves. (c) Relationship of woody biomass production vs. total biomass production. ‘Wood’ contains stem, branches, and coarse roots. ‘Roots’ is fine roots only. (d) Distribution of the fractional allocation to woody biomass. (e) Relationship of fine root biomass production vs. total biomass production. (b) Distribution of the fractional allocation to fine roots. Data from Peng et al. (n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe absence of woody biomass and C allocation to wood production in grasses and herbs as opposed to woody plants (trees and shrubs) is a major difference of allocation across different vegetation types and biomes. While in forests, about half of the total BP is in woody biomass, in grasslands, this is zero. In grasslands, the fractional allocation to leaves and fine roots is about twice as high as in forests (Table 5.1).\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Carbon allocation fractions in forests and grasslands. Wood contains stem, branches, and coarse roots. ‘Roots’ is fine roots only. Data from Peng et al. (n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetation\nLeaves\nWood\nRoots\n\n\n\n\nForest\n0.28\n0.47\n0.27\n\n\nGrassland\n0.47\n0.00\n0.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fractional belowground C allocation is under a strong influence by environmental conditions (nutrient availability, water availability, and CO2). The fraction of C allocated to fine root growth tends to increase under poor soil nutrient availability, under elevated CO2 (as seen in experiments), and under dry conditions. This can be understood as a response to the balance of above vs. belowground resource availabilities (light and CO2 vs. nutrients and water).\nBecause C in leaves and fine roots has a much shorter turnover time than in wood, allocation is a key quantity that controls the effective ecosystem C turnover time and ecosystem C dynamics. Thus, a changing environment affects ecosystem C dynamics, i.a., through its influence on allocation.\n\n\n5.1.4 Biomass turnover and litterfall\nTurnover of different plant compartments is driven by different processes. The leaf turnover in grasses and deciduous trees is linked to the seasons. In evergreen trees, the leaf turnover time (or leaf longevity) is commonly longer than one year and is related to the leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA - thicker leaves live longer). Leaves may also be damaged and shed after severe water stress and exposure to desiccation. Fine roots turn over at time scales of months to years. Woody biomass is much more long-lived than fine roots and leaf biomass. Its turnover is governed by tree mortality (Section 5.4) and ecosystem disturbances (Section 5.5) or the mortality of individual branches of a tree.\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Soil and litter C dynamics\nSenesced leaves are shed and, together with deadwood, form the litter pool on the ground surface. Litter is decomposed by soil microorganisms - heterotrophic organisms - that gain energy from consuming the organic matter. Litter also gets mixed into the topsoil by bioturbation (mixing by the soil fauna). C in the litter pool has a turnover time on the order of months to years for the fast-decomposing litter of dead leaves and fine roots (Figure 5.5), to 101-102 years for deadwood. Litter can have an important role as fuel for fire and as an insulation layer between soil and air.\nThe rate of litter decomposition is strongly affected by temperature and moisture. The warmer, the more rapid the decomposition. The moisture-dependency is a peaked relationship. Below the peak, decomposition increases with moisture. Above the peak, it declines due to a lack of oxygen. The decomposition rate is also influenced by the chemical composition. As a consequence of this environment-dependency, the time scale of litter decomposition varies across biomes (Figure 5.5). Lignified (woody) biomass decomposes more slowly than, e.g., fine roots and leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Litter decomposition in different biomes. Shown is the average mass remaining as a function of time for leaf (n = 5 to 6 species) and root (n = 3 species) litters decomposed in 21 sites. (A) Leaf litter decomposed in forest and tundra biomes; (B) root litter decomposed in forest and tundra biomes; (C) leaf litter decomposed in humid and arid grasslands; (D) root litter decomposed in humid and arid grasslands. Each species and litter type was decomposed in replicate bags and collected at multiple time points. Results show that leaf and root litter decomposition rates generally increase as the climatic decomposition index (CDI) increases (Table 1). In arid grasslands, leaf litter decomposed more rapidly than expected (based on the CDI), possibly due to photodegradation. The CDI is incorporates seasonality in temperature and moisture. Figure and caption text from Parton et al. (2007)\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil organic matter (SOM) refers to the organic mass fraction in soils. It consists of litter at advanced stages of decomposition and of microbial biomass and necromass. The decomposition rate of organic matter in soil can be strongly reduced compared to the decomposition rate of litter. This is due to stabilisation processes. Stabilisation of SOM arises from the chemical transformation through soil micro and macro-fauna and through physical protection in the soil matrix (association to minerals, occlusion in soil aggregates). Yet, the decomposition of SOM is rarely fully suppressed (except under fully anoxic conditions).\nSOM exposed to decomposition is consumed by microbes (fungi and bacteria) and fuels their growth. As they consume organic matter - like humans - they use the chemical energy “stored” in organic matter and oxidise the carbohydrates to CO2. The CO2 is respired away in gaseous form and leaves the soil volume and is referred to as heterotrophic respiration (\\(R_h\\)). The rate of microbial activity and hence \\(R_h\\) increases with temperature in a similar way as the temperature dependency of \\(R_a\\). \\(R_h\\) also depends on soil moisture and has a peaked relationship. It initially increases with increasing soil moisture until a point where the oxygen availability in the soil probihits activity by heterotrophic microorganisms. At this point, \\(R_h\\) drops sharply. Under water-logged soil conditions, SOM decomposition and \\(R_h\\) are suppressed. The temperature dependency of \\(R_h\\), implemented in the LPJ vegetation model is the same as described for \\(R_m\\) by Equation 5.1.\nSOM plays important roles for global biogeochemical cycles and for land-climate interactions. SOM is a vast store of C (~1700 PgC, see Figure 3.1). The soil organic matter content is an important measure for nutrient availability, and strongly influences the water holding capacity of the soil (Chapter 7). C in soil organic matter (SOM) has a turnover time on the order of years to centuries. Under anoxic conditions, the turnover time of SOM can attain millennia. As for litter decomposition, the rate of SOM decomposition (\\(k\\) in Equation 5.6) is controlled by the soil temperature and moisture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st-order decay model for litter and SOM\n\n\n\nSoil and litter C dynamics can be conceived as a 1-st order decay model, consisting of multiple pools, characterized by distinct turnover rates, and supplied with biomass turnover from different plant compartments. The dynamics of an individual pool can be described following 1st-order dynamics (Box in Section 3.2). \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t} = I - k(T,\\theta) \\;C \\;.\n\\tag{5.6}\\] Terrestrial biosphere models commonly treat the decay rate \\(k\\) as a function of temperature and moisture, as indicated in Equation 5.6 (\\(T\\) is temperature, \\(\\theta\\) is soil moisture). Some models also use the pH of the soil solution and the oxygen content in the soil for modifying \\(k\\). \\(k\\) at a standard temperature varies for different pools, ranging from 1/3-1 years-1 for litter, to 50-500 years-1 for SOM.\nExperiments of litter decomposition in the field, where a specified initial mass of litter is tracked over time (Figure 5.5), reveal a general pattern that is consistent with the 1st-order decay model. The solution of Equation 5.6 with \\(I=0\\) yields: \\[\nC(t) = C_0\\; e^{-k t}\\;,\n\\] where \\(t\\) is time. Indeed, the litter mass shown in Figure 5.5 exhibits an exponential decline over time.\nAlso SOM decay can be represented following Equation 5.6. In words, the amount of SOM C that gets decomposed in a given amount of time is proportional to the SOM C pool size. The input into that pool is independent of the pool itself.\nLitter and SOM pools in terrestrial biosphere models are most commonly represented by an array of pools that are characterized by different turnover times and that are connected following a specific structure. The litter pools receive inputs from biomass turnover. Decomposed litter is diverted to SOM pools. Fast-decomposing litter is diverted too a SOM pool with a short turnover time (high \\(k\\)), slow-decomposing litter is diverted to a SOM pool with a long turnover time. C is respired away as CO2 during litter and SOM decomposition. The microbial carbon use efficiency (\\(e\\)) determines the ratio of the decomposed C contributing to microbial biomass growth. \\((1-e)\\) is respired as CO2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Model for litter and SOM C pools and fluxes. Decomposition of fast and slow litter and SOM pools are modelled using Equation 5.6 with a relatively high and low k respectively. The input term I for each pool is depicted by straight arrows. e is the carbon use efficiency of litter decomposition. ffast is the fraction of litter decomposition diverted to the fast decomposing SOM pool. Rh is the heterotrophic respiration of C, leaving the system as CO2. This shows a simplified version of the litter and SOM model structure implemented in the LPJ terrestrial biosphere model (Sitch et al. 2003). ‘Fast’ and ‘slow’ litter pools are also commonly referred to as ‘metabolic’ and ‘structural’ litter, respectively. ‘Fast’ and ‘slow’ SOM pools are also commonly referred to as ‘active’ and ‘passive’, respectively - although the structure of how they are connected through mass transfers may differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Net ecosystem productivity\nThe net of gross primary productivity (GPP), autotrophic respiration by plants (\\(R_a\\)), and heterotrophic microorganisms (\\(R_h\\)) is referred to as the net ecosystem productivity, NEP. It is expressed in units of a flux of C mass per unit ground area and time, e.g., gC m-2 yr-1. It measures how much C accumulates in an ecosystem in the form of live biomass, litter, and soil (plus VOC and exudates). Since GPP and respiration terms typically have a strong seasonality and diurnal cycle and are not (perfectly) synchronized, NEP has a strong seasonality and diurnal cycle, too (see also Chapter 6). However, integrated over a year, the NEP is small - much smaller than the absolute of its components GPP, \\(R_a\\), and \\(R_h\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{NEP} &= \\mathrm{GPP} - R_a - R_h \\\\\n             &= \\mathrm{NPP} - R_h\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.7}\\] NEP can be measured by eddy covariance flux measurement technique (see also Chapter 15). The net CO2 exchange (NEE) between the canopy and the atmosphere is measured. It is termed NEE (and not NEP) because the processes and components are not directly identified by the measurement. For example, chemically dissolved C in the soil solution and particulate organic matter may be laterally transported off-site and is not reflected in the measurements. NEE is defined such that negative values indicate an net C gain by the ecosystem - opposite from the definition of NEP.\nThe classical model of ecological succession and an ecosystem’s carbon balance is that it reaches a steady state at time scales of forest stand maturity (shorter for grasslands), where, under constant environmental conditions, the NEP approaches zero. Respiration balances photosynthetic C uptake, biomass turnover balances biomass accumulation, and ecosystems become “C neutral” (Odum 1969).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Classical model of ecosystem an ecosystem’s carbon fluxes and balance. PG corresponds to GPP, PN to NPP, and R to Ra. The concept can be extended such that B is not only (live) biomass, but includes also litter and soil organic matter. Then, PN corresponds to NEP, and R is (Ra + Rh). Figure from (Odum 1969).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, field data of biomass stocks in mature forests seem to Odum’s steady state (and zero NEP) model (Luyssaert et al. 2008). Biometric data (forest inventories) and eddy covariance flux measurements from forests do not show a clear decline of NEP towards zero with increasing stand age, but rather show a sustained positive NEP over several decades to centuries since forest stand development.\nWill forests accumulate C infinitely? Tracking soil C stocks over millennia is per se not possible but clear patterns of a positive influence of soil age on SOM content would have to be evident in data - but are not. Biomass C stocks do not increase indefinitely, either. Individual trees in maturing forest stands continue accumulating biomass but the lifetime of a tree is limited due to hydraulic, mechanical, or C balance constraints whereby increasing respiratory costs pose limits to further growth and may trigger mortality. Self-thinning drives the exclusion of individual trees based on the competition for limited resources and leads to a negative relationship between the number and the average size of trees in a maturing forest stand (see Section 5.4). Therefore, although individual trees may accumulate C in the form of biomass for centuries, the biomass C accumulation at the stand level is much lower due to the declining tree number and the associated mortality, turnover, and decomposition of affected trees.\nVery old stands are dominated by few very large individual trees that contribute strongly to the total ecosystem biomass. However, also these individuals are inevitably affected by mortality. Once they fall, the ecosystem C stock rapidly declines (NEP is negative) and they create a forest gap that enables younger and smaller individuals to benefit from increased light levels. Smaller individuals around the newly formed gap accelerate growth, reach the canopy, and eventually fill the gap.\nThese dynamics imply that the NEP is rarely zero, but is positive for most of the time, except when affected by rare mortality events of large individuals. The spatial extent of a forest gap is on the order of 100-101 m and the maximum tree longevity is on the centuries (and the probability of a tree dying in a given year is its inverse - on the order of 10-2). This implies that the probability of observing a gap formation within a given areal extent is a function of the size of the areal extent. The larger the areal extent, the larger the probability that the influence of gap formation on NEP is captured and the large negative NEP of the gap is balanced by the small positive NEP of the remaining forest area. With an increasing size of the areal extent, the mean NEP should therefore tend to zero.\nForest monitoring plots are usually on the order of 20-50 m in radius. Hence, such data is sensitive to whether the observed plots are a representative sample of forest dynamics and forest gap formation across the landscape.\n\n\n5.1.7 Net biome productivity\nNet biome productivity (NBP, expressed in a mass carbon per unit ground area and time, for example gC m-2 yr-1) is the net of NEP and C loss by disturbances \\(\\Delta C_\\mathrm{dist}\\). The NBP is defined for large spatial domains - large enough to contain a representative sample of stochastically occurring disturbances. Across an entire biome, this is given. \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{NBP} &= \\mathrm{GPP} - R_a - R_h - \\Delta C_\\mathrm{dist} \\\\\n             &= \\mathrm{NEP} - \\Delta C_\\mathrm{dist}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.8}\\] Disturbances are commonly referred to as stand-replacing events that drive mortality in a large portion of individual plants of an ecosystem. Causes for disturbances include fire, pests, windthrow, or wood harvesting. A disturbance can be conceived as a re-setting of the “Odum-type” ecosystem succession. In contrast to the forest gap dynamics (Section 5.1.6), which play out at the level of individual trees, disturbances affect larger spatial extents (ecosystem or forest patches, Figure 5.8). However, the same aspects of stochasticity across the landscape applies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Scale in ecological investigations. The C balance of a forest patch is measured by the net ecosystem production. The C balance of a cluster or mosaic of multiple forest patches - each affected by a different land use history - is measured by the net biome production. Figure from Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the landscape-level, a forest can be conceived as a mosaic of forest patches, characterized by different times since the last stand-replacing disturbance. The first years after a disturbance, ecosystems tend to lose C (negative NEP). This is because the respiration from decomposing litter outweighs the biomass production of regrowth. After a few years, this balance reverses and the ecosystem total C stock increases. Although individual patches tend to have a positive NEP, a small portion of young patches will have a strongly negative NEP. When considering a large number of patches in absence of environmental change (driving trends in GPP, \\(R_a\\), \\(R_h\\) or the disturbance probability), the mean NEP across patches - this is the NBP - tends to zero.\nThe terrestrial carbon balance can be understood of the global total NBP.",

    "section": "5.2 The C cascade model",
    "text": "5.2 The C cascade model\nThe C cascade model (Figure 5.9) integrates the information about ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes, provided above in this Chapter. A key insight is that C only enters ecosystems through photosynthesis, measured at the ecosystem-level by GPP. Once in the system, it fuels a “cascade” of pools. They can be conceived as a cascade because biomass pools receive C inputs only through GPP (minus \\(R_a\\)), litter pools only receive C inputs through biomass turnover, and SOM pools only receive C inputs through litter decomposition. Along this cascade, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration incurs an ecosystem C loss. The rate at which C cascades through this system depends on the turnover rates of the individual pools and on the relative partitioning (allocation and partitioning to different litter and SOM pools) into the “downstream” pools. A schematic of the C cascade can be drawn by extending Figure 5.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: The carbon cascade in terrestrial ecosystems. Boxes indicate pools, arrows (including ‘pointed boxes’ for GPP and BP) indicate C fluxes. BPE is the biomass production efficiency. α is the fractional allocation, kl, kr, and kw are the decay constants of the leaf, root, and wood pool. e is the carbon use efficiency of litter decomposition. ffast is the fraction of litter decomposition diverted to the fast decomposing SOM pool. Rh is the heterotrophic respiration of C, leaving the system as CO2. Ra is autotrophic respiration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9 illustrates the pivotal role of BPE in determining how much C enters more long-lived storage as biomass vs. its largely immediate loss through respiration, of allocation in diverting C streams along cascades of very different turnover times (e.g., leaf vs. wood allocation), of microbial carbon use efficiency, and of processes determining the partitioning of C into (protected) slowly decomposing SOM pools and more rapidly decomposing SOM pools.\nIn Chapter 3, we simulated the response of terrestrial C storage to an increased GPP using a 1-box model and 1st-order decay. In this Chapter, we have “unboxed” C storage in terrestrial ecosystems, distinguishing a suite of pools and fluxes, arranged in a cascading order. When considering the response of this system to a change in GPP, how does the more complex representation affect the dynamics?\nA key characteristic of the 1st order decay model is that the steady-state C pool size \\(C^\\ast\\) is proportional to (is linearly dependent on) the input flux (Equation 3.4). Hence, with an change in the input flux of \\(x = I/I_0\\), the steady-state pools size changes also by \\(x = C^\\ast/C^\\ast_0\\).\nIt can be demonstrated (see Box ‘Simulating the C cascade’ below) that when considering the following properties for the C cascade model:\n\n1st-order decay dynamics of all pools\nconstant \\(\\alpha\\), \\(k_i\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f_\\mathrm{fast}\\)\n\n…, the same linear dependency of the total system C storage \\(\\sum_i C_i^\\ast\\) emerges: \\[\n\\frac{I}{I_0} = \\frac{\\sum_i C_i^\\ast}{\\sum_i C_{i,0}^\\ast} = \\frac{C_i^\\ast}{C_{i,0}^\\ast}, \\; \\forall i\n\\] The symbol \\(\\forall\\) means ‘for all’. However, whether a model with constant \\(\\alpha\\), \\(k_i\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f_\\mathrm{fast}\\) is a good representation of real ecosystems’ responses to environmental change is questionable. It is well established, for example, that \\(\\alpha\\) is very sensitive altered soil nutrient availability and changes in CO2 experiments (Poorter et al. 2012). The turnover rate of biomass in forests (or tree longevity) may be affected by accelerated self-thinning if environmental change positively influences tree-level growth (e.g., through CO2 fertilization or an extension of the growing season) (Marqués et al. 2023). This implies a departure from the linear systems behavior of the C cascade model described by the two points above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating the C cascade\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two points (see above) are implemented in a multi-box model:\n\n1st-order decay dynamics of all pools\nconstant \\(\\alpha\\), \\(k_i\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f_\\mathrm{fast}\\)\n\nThe following parameters are set:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsource(here::here(\"R/ccascade.R\"))\ngetpar() |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbpe\nfleaf\nfroot\nfwood\nkleaf\nkwood\nkroot\nkflitt\nkslitt\nkfsoil\nkssoil\neff\nffast\n\n\n\n\n0.4\n0.3\n3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.02\n0.5\n0.5\n0.1\n0.1\n0.003\n0.6\n0.95\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Parameters of the C cascade model. ‘bpe’ is the biomass production efficiency (unitless). ‘fleaf’, ‘froot’, and ‘fwood’ are the fractional allocation factors to leaves, roots, and wood (unitless). ‘kleaf’, ‘kwood’, and ‘kroot’ are the decay constants of the leaf, wood, and root pool, respectively (in yr-1). ‘kflitt’ and ‘kslitt’ are the decay constants of the fast and slow litter pools, respectively (in yr-1). ‘kfsoil’ and ‘kssoil’ are the decay constants of the fast and slow soil pools, respectively (in yr-1). ‘eff’ is the carbon use efficiency of litter decomposition. ‘ffast’ is the fraction of litter decomposition diverted to the fast-turnover soil pool\n\n\n\n\nThe model is “spun-up” to a steady state for 3000 simulation years. The turnover time of the slowest pool (here the slow soil pool, kssoil = 0.003, corresponding to 333 years) is indicative of how long the model has to be spun-up.\nThe GPP is then increased from 100 PgC yr-1 during the first 3000 simulation years to 120 PgC yr-1 for the subsequent 3000 simulation years.\n\n\nCode\n# specify GPP for each simulation year as a vector\ngpp &lt;- c(rep(100, 3000), rep(120, 3000))\n\n# run the model, it returns a data frame\ndf &lt;- ccascade(gpp)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(year, cleaf, color = \"Leaf C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, cwood, color = \"Wood C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, croot, color = \"Root C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, flitt, color = \"Fast litter C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, slitt, color = \"Slow litter C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, fsoil, color = \"Fast soil C\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(year, ssoil, color = \"Slow soil C\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2500, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5500, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  xlim(2000, 6000) +\n  khroma::scale_color_okabeito(name = \"\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Simulation year\", y = \"Pool size (PgC)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Time series of the pool sizes in the C cascade model, forced with an increase of GPP from 100 to 120 PgC yr-1. The first 2000 simulation years are not shown as they are used for model spin-up. The years used for quantifying relative changes below are indicated by the vertical dotted lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relative change in each pool can be quantified by comparing the pool sizes, e.g., in simulation year 2500, with the pool sizes in simulation year 5500.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndf_plot &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(year == 2500) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(2:10, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value_2500\") |&gt; \n  select(-year) |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    df |&gt; \n      filter(year == 5500) |&gt; \n      pivot_longer(2:10, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value_5500\") |&gt; \n      select(-year),\n    by = \"variable\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(rel_change = value_5500 / value_2500)\n\ndf_plot |&gt; \n  filter(!(variable %in% c(\"ra\", \"rh\"))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(value_2500, value_5500, color = variable)) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1.2, color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  khroma::scale_color_okabeito(name = \"\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(x = \"Pool size in year 2500 (PgC)\", \n       y = \"Pool size in year 5500 (PgC)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Initial pool size (after spin-up and before step-change in GPP) along the x-axis and final pool size along the y-axis (in PgC). The 1:1 line (slope = 1, intercept = 0) is shown by the dotted line. The grey line has a slope of 1.2 (intercept = 0).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis illustrates that the relative change in the size of each pool in the C cascade is identical and corresponds to the relative change in GPP. In other words, the C cascade with constant allocation, turnover rates, and efficiencies exhibits a linear systems dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the C balance effect of planting a forest?\n\n\n\nPlanting a forest on land that was previously a grassland, if well attended to and not affected by disturbances (e.g., drought-induced tree mortality, pests, or fire), may lead an increase in the biomass C stock over the course of several decades. Ignoring effects on the soil C stock, this implies that planting a forest sequesters C.\nHow does this relate to the C cascade description of ecosystem C dynamics in this chapter? A notable aspect is that photosynthesis rates and GPP are similar in grasslands and forests. If the same amount of C enters the ecosystem, why is the C storage larger in a forest than in a grassland?\nOf course, C in woody biomass has a much longer turnover time than C in leaves and fine roots. Therefore, following the logic of the box modelling and 1st-order decay, the steady-state C stock in biomass is larger in a forest than in a grassland despite GPP being similar.\nHow effective are forest plantations for compensating CO2 emissions? Again, let’s turn to the box model. We may assume that GPP is 1500 gC m-2 yr-1 and that a forest is planted in simulation year 10 - implemented in the model by increasing the allocation fraction to wood from zero initially (in a grassland) to 0.5 from year 10 onwards. The turnover time of leaves and fine roots is 2 years and 50 years for woody biomass.\nThe model simulation below shows the accumulation of vegetation biomass (leaf, root, and wood C) over time and the net ecosystem productivity - measuring the C balance of the ecosystem.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nsource(here::here(\"R/ccascade.R\"))\n\n# first spin up the C cascade model representing a grassland\n# modify default parameters for allocation\npar &lt;- getpar()\npar$fwood &lt;- 0\npar$fleaf &lt;- 0.5\npar$froot &lt;- 0.5\n\n# specify GPP (gC m-2 yr-1) for each simulation year as a vector\ngpp &lt;- rep(1500, 3000)\n\n# run the model, it returns a data frame\ndf_spinup &lt;- ccascade(gpp, par = par)\n\n# save state and fluxes after spinup\nstate &lt;- df_spinup |&gt; \n  tail(1) |&gt; \n  select(cleaf, cwood, croot, flitt, slitt, fsoil, ssoil) |&gt; \n  as.list()\n\nfluxes &lt;- df_spinup |&gt; \n  tail(1) |&gt; \n  select(ra, rh) |&gt; \n  as.list()\n\n# run model forward (300 years), converting to forest in year 10 (changing allocation)\n# GPP as forcing\ngpp &lt;- rep(1500, 300)\n\nlen &lt;- length(gpp)\n\n# output the state and fluxes in one data frame\ndf &lt;- dplyr::tibble()\n\n# integrate over each time step (this is an implementation of the differential equation)\nfor (yr in seq(len)){\n  \n  if (yr == 10){\n    par$fwood &lt;- 0.5\n    par$fleaf &lt;- 0.3\n    par$froot &lt;- 0.2\n  }\n\n  # update states and fluxes\n  out &lt;- ccascade_onestep(\n    gpp[yr], \n    state, \n    par, \n    fluxes\n    )\n  \n  state &lt;- out$state\n  fluxes &lt;- out$fluxes\n\n  # record for output\n  df &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(\n    df,\n    dplyr::bind_cols( \n      dplyr::tibble(year = yr),\n      dplyr::as_tibble(state), \n      dplyr::as_tibble(fluxes))\n    )\n}\n\n\ngg1 &lt;- df |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(year, (cleaf + cwood + croot)/1000)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Simulation year\", \n    y = expression(paste(\"Biomass C (kgC m\"^-2, \")\"))\n    )\n\ngg2 &lt;- df |&gt; \n  mutate(nep = gpp - ra - rh) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(year, nep)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Simulation year\", \n    y = expression(paste(\"NEP (gC m\"^-2, \"yr\"^-1, \")\"))\n    )\n\nplot_grid(gg1, gg2, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.13: Simulated biomass C and the ecosystem C balance (measured by NEP) in response to planting a forest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis illustrates that a forest is only a net C sink during its establishment. Once a new steady state is reached, biomass C no longer increases and NEP declines to zero. Forest plantations do not provide sustained CO2 removal. A mature forests tends towards becoming “C-neutral”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nWhich pool in the C cascade model (Figure 5.9) has the slowest C turnover?

    "text": "6.1 Solar radiation\nPPFD is a fraction of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (\\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\)). This fraction depends on the planetary albedo for visible light (\\(\\alpha_v\\), unitless), an atmospheric attenuation factor (\\(\\tau\\), unitless) that accounts for the elevation (\\(z\\))-dependent path length of a light ray travelling through the atmosphere and a factor that accounts for cloud cover \\(f_c\\).

    "text": "6.1.1 Solar geometry\nLet’s first step outside the atmosphere and focus on the solar geometry to understand \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). Solar geometry describes the cyclical movement of the Earth around the sun and how the resulting cyclically varying amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth. The top-of-the atmosphere perspective is relevant to separate atmospheric effects from planetary effects.\n\\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) scales in proportion with the solar constant \\(I_S\\) (1360.8 W m-2) and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the Earth and the sun (\\(r_E\\)). \\[\nI_\\mathrm{TOA} = I_S r_E^{-2} \\cos \\theta_z\n\\tag{6.3}\\] \\(\\theta_z\\) is the solar zenith angle. The term \\(\\cos \\theta_z\\) accounts for the dependence of the solar radiation on the angle at which the sun’s rays reach the Earth surface (no terrain considered). It varies cyclically over the course of a day (with hour-of-day) and over the course of a year (with day-of-year). The zenith angle is zero when the sun is directly above the observer - in the zenith (Figure 6.2). At this point, the intensity of the solar radiation is at its maximum.\nNote that \\(r_E\\) is not constant over the course of a year as the Earth rotates around the sun not following a perfect circle but an ellipse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dependence of the solar zenith angle on the hour-of-day, day-of-year, and the latitude is described by \\[\n\\cos \\theta_z = \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\delta +\\cos \\varphi \\cos \\delta \\cos h\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\n\n\\(\\varphi\\) is the local latitude in radians (0 at the equator, \\(\\pi/2\\) at the poles)\n\\(\\delta\\) is the solar declination angle.

The summer solstice (21 June) is indicated by the dotted line. Note that the curves are not perfectly symmetrical with respect to the summer solstice line. This is because the Earth moves around the sun on an ellipse and hence the distance between the Earth and the sun varies over the year. The distance is at its minimum near the southern-hemispheric summer solstice.

The photosynthetic apparatus is constructed to make best use of the light, even during the hours of peak light intensity at mid-day. The phenological phases of plant growth reflect the light distribution over the seasons - evergreen plants dominate in the moist tropics to make use of the light year-round, while deciduous leaf strategies and annual life history strategies dominate in the northern latitudes where the seasonal fluctuation of light is large.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Long-term variations in solar radiation\nSolar irradiance\nThe solar constant \\(I_S\\) isn’t actually constant but varies on the order of 0.1% of the course of a solar cycle. One cycle is approximately 11 years. The cyclic behavior is related to the periodic flip of the sun’s magnetic field and the number of sunspots. The radiation emitted from the sun and the number of sunspots are at their minimum after a magnetic flip. There is also a small long-term trend in the solar radiation, having increased by &lt;0.1% since the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715). Solar irradiance is measured at high altitude to minimize the influence of the atmosphere (\\(\\tau\\) in Eq. Equation 6.1) and get information about how \\(I_S\\) varies. Reconstructions of solar irradiance changes for the pre-instrumental period are based on the relationship between \\(I_S\\) and the (easily observable) sunspot number. Variations in \\(I_S\\) are small and do not have a dominant effect on climate and the carbon cycle that would override other forcings, especially for the industrial period (IPCC 2021).\nVolcanic activity\nVolcanic eruptions can influence the solar radiation at the Earth surface. Events that reduce solar radiation by more than 1 W m-2 occur approximately every 35-40 years (Gulev et al. 2021) and affect climate and the carbon cycle for up to a few years after very large eruptions. The increased aerosol load in the atmosphere reduces the total radiative energy flux (reducing \\(\\tau\\) in Eq. Equation 6.1). However, through the strong positive effect of the aerosol load on the share of diffuse versus direct radiation, volcanic aerosols can affect the terrestrial carbon cycle, (somehow surprisingly) leading to a greater land C sink following years of large volcanic eruptions (Section 4.2).\nOrbital parameters\nThe largest changes in \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) arise over millennial time scales and are related to variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun. These Milankovic cycles are the trigger for the large climate swings between ice ages and warm periods over the course of ~100,000 years. Variations in the orbital parameters affect the latitudinal and seasonal distribution of \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). Orbital parameters that vary periodically are:\n\nThe eccentricity of the Earth’s elliptical orbit which affects the distance between the Earth and the sun, affecting \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\) via \\(r_E\\) in Equation 6.3. It varies with a period of approximately 100,000 years.\nThe obliquity - the tilt of the axis of the Earth’s own rotation relative to the plane in which the Earth rotates around the sun. A greater obliquity amplifies seasonal variations in \\(I_\\mathrm{TOA}\\). The obliquity is currently at 23.44°. At its minimum, it’s at 21.1°. Obliquity varies over 41,000 years.\nThe precession is the rotation of the Earth’s own rotation axis itself. The effect of precession, in combination with the fact that the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, is that the variation of the sun-Earth distance shifts over the seasons. It varies with a period of about 25,700 years.\n\nThe point of minimal distance coinciding with the summer solstice leads to the largest mid-summer radiation maximum. As a result, the incident solar radiation over the northern-hemispheric summer at 65°N varied by about 83 W m-2 during the past million years. These changes are much larger than the ones driven by solar irradiance and volcanic activity.\nAbout 6000 years ago, during the Mid-Holocene Warm Period, a summer maximum insolation for the northern hemisphere was reached (Figure 6.6). During this period, temperatures and solar irradiance during the growing season were elevated relative to the pre-industrial period and precipitation patterns shifted. This had profound effects on vegetation and the carbon cycle. Testimony to this change are reconstructions that document a “Green Sahara” and a northward shift temperate and boreal forest biomes (MacDonald et al. 2000; Prentice, Jolly, and Participants 2000) during this period.\n\n\nCode\n# test:\n# tmp &lt;- purrr::map(seq(from = -300000, to = 2000, by = 500),\n#                   ~calc_daily_solar(65, 173, year = .)) |&gt;\n#   purrr::map_dbl(\"ra_j.m2\")\n\n# all combinations of day-of-year and latitude\ndf_holo &lt;- expand.grid(\n  doy = seq(1, 365, by = 2),\n  lat = seq(-90, 90, by = 2)\n  ) |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(s_toa_holo = calc_daily_solar(lat, doy, year = -4000)$ra_j.m2) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    df,\n    by = c(\"doy\", \"lat\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(diff = (s_toa_holo - s_toa))\n\ndf_holo |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = doy,\n             y = lat,\n             fill = diff)) +\n  geom_raster() +\n  khroma::scale_fill_roma(reverse = TRUE) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 173, linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Mid-Holocene top-of-atmosphere solar radiation anomaly\",\n       subtitle = expression(paste(\"Daily total, \", italic(I)[TOA], \"(6 kyr BP) - \", italic(I)[TOA], \"(present)\" )),\n       x = \"Day of year\",\n       y = \"Latitude (°N)\",\n       fill = expression(paste(\"J m\"^-2))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Mid-Holocene solar radiation anomaly, calculated as the difference in the daily total top-of-atmosphere solar radiation at 6 kyr BP minus present-day (year 2000).",

    "text": "6.2 Phenology\nIn general, phenology refers to the study of periodic events of biological activity. In most cases, such periodic events are linked the seasonal variations of the climate. In the context of terrestrial photosynthesis and land-climate interactions, the most important phenological event is the leaf unfolding and leaf senescence and shedding in response to seasonal variations in temperature, radiation, and water availability. The presence (or absence) of active green leaves has major implications for the CO2, water vapour, and energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere.\nIn winter-cold climates (climate zones C, D, and E, see Figure 2.22), leaf phenology of deciduous plants is driven by the seasonal fluctuations of temperature and radiation. Leaves are shed before winter to avoid damage by cold temperatures and because the limited gains by C assimulation during dark and cold winter months does not outweigh the costs for maintenance of vital functions. In seasonally dry climates (mainly climate zones Am, Aw, see Figure 2.22), leaves are shed to avoid water loss and avoid dangerous desiccation of the plant. Leaf area also varies more gradually in response to seasonal variations in climate. LAI can have a seasonal cycle also in evergreen forests and shrublands. In grasslands, LAI typically has a strong seasonal cycle, with rapid foliage development and senescence during the typically relatively short vegetation period - but without the typical budbreak, leaf unfolding, and leaf shedding as in deciduous trees.\nPhotosynthesis and the exchange of CO2 between the land surface and the atmosphere are very directly affected by the amount of active green leaves - as measured by fAPAR (Equation 4.1). Coupled to this exchange is the exchange of water vapour and the surface energy balance. Therefore, leaf phenology is a primary control on land-climate interactions and the carbon cycle. Leaf phenology is not only a driver of land-climate interactions, but is also driven by climate. Different controls act on the leaf unfolding and leaf senescence dates.\n\n6.2.1 Leaf unfolding\nIn winter-cold (temperate and boreal) deciduous forests, the timing of leaf unfolding (bud-burst) is sensitive to temperatures prior to the leaf unfolding date. Warm temperatures in early spring accelerate leaf unfolding and can lead to a shift of spring phenology dates by several days or even weeks. Phenology models commonly use the concept of growing degree days (GDD) (Basler 2016) and consider a critical GDD (GDD*) for predicting leaf unfolding. Growing degree days on day \\(j\\) is defined as the cumulative sum of temperatures above a specified threshold (\\(T_0\\), most commonly \\(T_0 = 5^\\circ\\)C), counting from a given start date \\(M\\).\n\\[\n\\text{GDD}_{T_0,j}=\\sum_{i=M}^j \\max(T_i-T_0, 0)\n\\] The leaf unfolding date is then modeled as the day at which GDD* is reached. In other words, the leaf unfolding is triggered by the accumulated “warmth”. The GDD concept is also commonly used for modelling crop development stages in crop models (distinguishing vegetative growth, seed filling, etc.). GDD* is assumed to be a constant in space and time but may be distinguished by tree species (some trees require a higher GDD - more “warmth” - to start leaf unfolding than others.)\nMore complex models consider also abiotic factors leading up to the phase (endodormancy, state of inactivity mediated by factor inside the bud, (Basler 2016)) where an increasing GDD drives bud development and leaf unfolding. For example, some models consider the requirement of a chilling phase - a period of cool, but non-freezing temperatures in the range of 2–7°C (Basler 2016) - and photoperiod (measuring the seasonal variation of daylength). However, complex models do not generally yield better predictive power than simple GDD-based models (Basler 2016). It should also be noted that models relying purely on temperature for modelling leaf unfolding may have limited applicability for simulating responses to long-term climatic trends. Plant-specific, biotic factors responding to photoperiod impose bounds on the sensitivity of phenology to temperature (Christian Körner and David Basler 2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Mean seasonal cycle of air temperature (a), growing degree days (GDD, b), and leaf area index (LAI, c) at a deciduous temperate forest site in Germany (DE-Hai FLUXNET site). LAI data is from MODIS remote sensing. 5°C is indicated by the dotted line in (a). GDD is calculated with respect to a 5°C base temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere in Switzerland, most trees start leaf unfolding in the second half of April. Why are leaves of winter-cold deciduous trees not unfolding earlier in the year (given that there is light available for photosynthesis)? Leaf shedding is a protection of plants against frost. At temperatures below freezing, costly cell protection measures against frozen water and excessive photosynthetic light harvesting are required to avoiding damage. Delayed leaf unfolding is a strategy to avoid such damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCheck out our tutorial here to learn more about phenology modelling and fitting the GDD model to remotely sensed phenology data\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Leaf senescence\nLeaf senescence in temperate and boreal deciduous forests is - similarly as leaf unfolding - a strategy to avoid stress and damage by low temperatures in winter. Before leaf abscission (leaf shedding), the leaf nutrients are resorbed and photosynthetic activity starts declining. Leaves are rich in nutrients. A large fraction of nutrients contained in leaf biomass, in particular nitrogen (N), are linked to photosynthesis - mostly Rubisco. These nutrients are re-mobilised before leaf abscission and resorbed into plant-internal storage compartments. Thereby, the loss of “costly” nutrients can be avoided. A side effect of the nutrient resorption is the change of the leaf color to yellow, reddish, or brown.\nEnvironmental controls on leaf senescence are not the same as for leaf unfolding and vary between tree species. Model predictability for leaf senescence dates is generally lower than for leaf unfolding dates, observed global trends are less clear (Piao et al. 2019), and drivers less well understood (Richardson et al. 2013) than for spring phenology. Photoperiod and temperature are considered important abiotic controls on leaf senescence dates. While photoperiod sets the induction of the end-of-season phenology, temperature modulates its progression with cold temperatures accelerating leaf senescence (Christian Körner and David Basler 2010). Also the timing of leaf unfolding can appears to affect the timing of leaf senescence [Keenan and Richardson (2015); marques23natee]. An earlier leaf unfolding in spring appears to induce an earlier leaf senescence in autumn. Processes driving this pattern may be related to cell aging and a conserved leaf longevity, but may also be related to the ecosystem water balance and premature defoliation as a response to dry soil conditions (after vegetation has started consuming water earlier in spring).\n\n\n6.2.3 Phenology trends and spatial patterns\nSince leaf unfolding and senescence phenology is sensitive to climate, patterns in spring phenology emerge across climatic gradients and over the course of long-term climate change. Phenology is very evident for an observer without technical instruments and the timing of phenological dates can be relatively well determined. This has enabled the recording of phenological dates since centuries and long-term phenological records now impressively document the unprecedented current warming in the context of the last few centuries Figure 6.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Phenological indicators of changes in growing season. (a) Cherry blossom peak bloom in Kyoto, Japan; (b) grape harvest in Beaune, France; (c) spring phenology index in eastern China; (d) full flower of Piedmont species in Philadelphia, USA; (e) grape harvest in Central Victoria, Australia; (f) start of growing season in Tibetan Plateau, China. Red lines depict the 25-year moving average (top row) or the nine-year moving average (middle and bottom rows). Figure and caption taken from Gulev et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariations in leaf unfolding dates are also evident across space, i.e., across climatic gradients in space. In mountainous regions, climatic gradients are steep and variations in the timing of leaf unfolding can be observed by eye - or from space across a larger region (Figure 6.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Spring phenology patterns along elevation in Switzerland.
